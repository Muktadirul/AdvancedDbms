The contents of one sachet or two effervescent tablets should always be made up to 200ml with water (the product must not be reconstituted in diluents other than water, e.g. must not be included in milk solutions). A weaker solution than recommended will fail to provide adequate sugar and electrolytes and a stronger solution than recommended may give rise to hypernatraemia. Intravenous rehydration is required for dehydrated children with shock, very large stool losses (&gt;10mL/kg/hour), severe vomiting that interferes with oral fluid replacement, or glucose malabsorption. Patients with gastroenteritis should be monitored carefully to ensure that their condition does not deteriorate. In particular, young infants may become severely dehydrated in a short time.&#10;Patients and/or parents should be advised to seek medical advice if the condition worsens. Clinicians should particularly ensure patients are aware of the risk of dehydration in young children and infants. Early warning signs of impending dehydration should be discussed.&#10;Seek medical advice if diarrhoea persists for more than 6 hours in infants under 6 months, 12 hours in children aged 6 months to 3 years, 24 hours in children aged 3 to 6 years and 48 hours in children over 6 years of age.</field>

		<field name="mode_of_action">Oral rehydration salts are given orally to prevent or treat dehydration due to acute diarrhoea. Essential water and salts are lost in stools and vomitus, and dehydration results when blood volume is decreased because of fluid loss from the extracellular fluid compartment. Preservation of the facilitated glucose-sodium cotransport system in the small-bowel mucosa is the rationale of oral rehydration therapy. Glucose is actively absorbed in the normal intestine and carries sodium with it in about an equimolar ration. Therefore, there is a greater net absorption of an isotonic salt solution with glucose than one without it. Potassium replacement during acute diarrhoea prevents below-normal serum concentrations of potassium, especially in children, in whom stool potassium losses are higher than in adults. Bicarbonates are effective in correcting the metabolic acidosis caused by diarrhoea and dehydration.</field>

These omega-3 fatty acids keep blood triglycerides in check (high triglycerides are generally linked with increased risk of heart diseases) and may inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis. They also have anti-inflammatory activity; as a result they are also helpful in Crohn&apos;s disease and rheumatoid arthritis. It has been also found that omega- 3 fatty acids are needed for prostaglandin formation. Probably as a result of their effect on prostaglandin they are responsible for blood vessel dilation. A double blind trial found that omega- 3 fatty acids helped to treat patient with Raynaud&apos;s disease.

		<field name="precaution">General: Anemia is a manifestation that requires appropriate investigation to determine its cause or causes. No single regimen fits all cases and the status of the patient observed in follow-up is the final criterion for adequacy of therapy. Periodic clinical and laboratory studies are considered essential. Blood examinations including hemoglobin and hematacrit should be done at the usual intervals to make certain that therapy is adequate. Use with care in the presence of peptic ulcer, regional enteritis, and ulcerative colitis. Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg -0.4 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematological remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.</field>
		<field name="indication">Vitamin/mineral deficiency during pregnancy and lactation</field>
		<field name="contra_indication"> Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients; also, all iron compounds are contraindicated in patients with hemosiderosis, hemochromatosis, or hemolytic anemias. Pernicious anemia is a contraindication, as folic acid may obscure its signs and symptoms.</field>
		<field name="dose">Adults (persons over 12 years of age), One (1) capsule daily, between meals, or as prescribed by a physician. Do not exceed recommended dosage. Do not administer to children under the age of 12.</field>
		<field name="side_effect"> Allergic sensitizations have been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid. Ferrous Fumarate: Gastrointestinal disturbances (anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, heartburn and vomiting) occur occasionally, but are usually mild and may subside with continuation of therapy. Reducing the dose and administering it with meals will minimize these effects in the sensitive patient. Increasing fiber in the diet can relieve constipation. Iron may turn stools black. This is a harmless effect that is a result of unabsorbed iron. Although the absorption of iron is best when taken between meals, giving Integra FTM after meals may control occasional G.I. disturbances. Integra FTM is best absorbed when taken at bedtime.</field>

		<field name="mode_of_action">Astaxanthin is a xanthophyll carotenoid. It is an antioxidant with anti-inflammatory properties and as such has potential as a therapeutic agent in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Similar in structure to beta-carotene, this antioxidant also helps living organisms to quench, scavenge and trap free radicals inside its structure. Not only can it trap these harmful toxins effectively, it also has the ability to trap more types of radicals, such as singlet and triplet oxygen. Typically, a substance will lose an electron (a process that destabilizes the substance), when going through a metabolic process. Instead of sacrificing an electron, astaxanthin stabilizes these metabolic toxins radicals by simply adding them to its own double-bonded chain.&#10;&#10;It also aids in preventing lipid peroxidation, as well as enhances the protective capacities of other antioxidants in the body. Astaxanthin has the ability to stop and reverse oxidative damage to both the totality of a cell’s structures, as well as healthy forms of cholesterol.&#10;</field>

Max: 80 mg/day.&#10;&#10;Child: Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: 10-17 yr 10 mg once daily, may increase at intervals of at least 4 wk to max 20 mg/day.&#10;Elderly: No dosage adjustment needed.&#10;&#10;Atorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. Therapy should be individualized according to goal of therapy and response. After initiation and/or upon titration of Atorvastatin, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. Since the goal of treatment is to lower LDL-C, the LDL-C levels should be used to initiate and assess treatment response. Only if LDL-C levels are not available, should total-C be used to monitor therapy. &#10;&#10;Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: The dosage of Atorvastatin in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. Atorvastatin should be used as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (eg, LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. &#10;&#10;Dosage in Patients with Renal Insufficiency: Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations or LDL-C reduction of atorvastatin; thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary. &#10;&#10;Pediatric Use: Treatment experience in a pediatric population is limited to doses of Atorvastatin up to 80 mg/day for 1 year in 8 patients with homozygous FH. No clinical or biochemical abnormalities were reported in these patients. None of these patients was below 9 years of age. &#10;&#10;Geriatric Use: Treatment experience in adult’s age 70 years with doses of Atorvastatin up to 80 mg/day has been evaluated. The safety and efficacy of Atorvastatin in this population were similar to those of patients &lt;70 years of age.&#10;</field>

Oxybenzone can be considered a broad-spectrum absorber. It significantly augments UV-B protection when used in a given formula. &#10;Avobenzone&#10;Often referred to by its trade name, Parsol 1789, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane or avobenzone provides superior protection through a large portion of the UV-A range, including UV-A I. A significant addition to sunscreen products for true broad-spectrum UV protection, concerns have been raised regarding its photostability and its potential to degrade other sunscreen ingredients in products in which it is used. &#10;Titanium dioxide&#10;The ideal sunscreen agent would be chemically inert, safe, and absorb or reflect through the full UV spectrum. Titanium dioxide meets these criteria limited only by aesthetics. By decreasing the particle size of this pigment to microsize or ultrafine grades, thereby making it less visible on the skin surface, some of these advantages could be used.

It is a monosulfamyl diuretic that acts by enhancing the excretion of sodium and chloride ions, and water by interfering with the transport of sodium ions across the renal tubular epithelium. Their primary site of action appears to be at the cortical diluting segment in the nephron of the loop of Henle.</field>
		<field name="interaction"> &#9;NSAIDs antagonise hypotensive action. Suppresses action of oral anticoagulants due to reduced prothrombin activity. Increased risk of hypokalaemia when corticosteroids are given concurrently.&#10;Potentially Fatal: Potentiates bone marrow suppression caused by anticancer drugs. Diuretic-induced vol depletion can potentiate aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity. Impairs action of oral hypoglycaemic agents. Enhances digitalis toxicity due to hypokalaemia. vol depletion enhances lithium toxicity, conversely, sudden withdrawal of diuretics may result in subtherapeutic levels of circulating lithium.

		<field name="generic_name">Cyclosporine</field>
		<field name="precaution"> Cyclosporine increases the risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly those of the skin. So patients should be warned to avoid excess ultraviolet light exposure. Cyclosporine may develop bacterial, fungal, parasitic and viral infections. So therapeutic strategies should be employed for long-term immunosuppressive therapy. A reversible increase in serum creatinine and urea may occur during the first few weeks of Cyclosporine therapy and usually responding to dose reduction. In elderly patients, renal function should be monitored with particular care. Regular monitoring of blood pressure is required during Cyclosporine therapy; if hypertension develops, appropriate antihypertensive treatment must be instituted.  Cyclosporine enhances the risk of hyperkalaemia, especially in patients with renal dysfunction. Caution is also required when Cyclosporine is co-administered with potassium sparing drugs. Cyclosporine enhances the clearance of magnesium. If considered necessary, magnesium supplementation should be given. Caution should be observed in treating patients with hyperuricaemia. During treatment with Cyclosporine, vaccination may be less effective; the use of live-attenuated vaccines should be avoided. Non-transplant patients with impaired renal function, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled infections, or any kind of malignancy should not receive Cyclosporine.

		<field name="precaution">The possibility of circulatory overload should be kept in mind. Special care should be exercised in patients with impaired renal clearance of dextran. When the risk of pulmonary edema and/or congestive heart failure may be increased, dextran should be used with caution.&#10;&#10;In patients with normal hemostasis, dosage of LMD (dextran 40) approximating 15 mL/kg of body weight may prolong bleeding time and depress platelet function. Dosages in this range also markedly decrease factor VIII, and decrease factors V and IX to a greater degree than would be expected to occur from hemodilution alone. Since these changes tend to be more pronounced following trauma or major surgery, patients should be observed for early signs of bleeding complications.&#10;&#10;Since increased rouleaux formation may occur in the presence of dextran, it is recommended that blood samples be drawn for typing and cross-matching prior to the infusion of dextran and reserved for subsequent use if necessary. If blood is drawn after infusion of dextran, the saline agglutination and indirect antiglobulin methods may be used for typing and cross-matching. Difficulty may be encountered when proteolytic enzyme techniques are used to match blood.&#10;&#10;Consideration should be given to withdrawal of blood for chemical laboratory tests prior to initiating therapy with dextran because of the following:&#10;&#10;    Blood sugar determinations that employ high concentrations of acid may result in hydrolysis of dextran, yielding falsely elevated glucose assay results. This has been observed both with sulfuric acid and with acetic acid.&#10;&#10;    In other laboratory tests, the presence of dextran in the blood may result in the development of turbidity, which can interfere with the assay. This has been observed in bilirubin assays in which alcohol is employed and in total protein assays employing biuret reagent.&#10;&#10;Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or overt diabetes mellitus.&#10;&#10;Caution must be exercised in the administration of parenteral fluids, especially those containing sodium ions, to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin.&#10;&#10;Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged. Discard unused portion. </field>

		<field name="contra_indication">Patients with known hypersensitivity to dextran, in those with marked hemostatic defects of all types (thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, etc.) including those caused by drugs (heparin, warfarin, etc.), marked cardiac decompensation and in renal disease with severe oliguria or anuria.</field>
		<field name="dose">DextranI/V should be administered prior to administration of clinical dextran solutions.&#10;&#10;    In shock, it is suggested that total dosage not exceed 20 mL/kg for adults and adolescents, during the first 24 hours. The first 10 mL/kg may be infused as rapidly as necessary to effect improvement. It is strongly recommended that central venous pressure be monitored frequently during the initial infusion of the drug. Should therapy continue beyond 24 hours, subsequent dosage should not exceed 10 mL/kg per day and therapy should not continue beyond five days.&#10;&#10;  In prophylaxis of venous thrombosis and thromboembolism, the dosage  for adults and adolescents, should be chosen according to the risk of thromboembolic complications, e.g., type of surgery and duration of immobilization. In general, treatment should be initiated during surgery; 500 to 1000 mL (approximately 10 mL/kg of body weight) should be administered on the day of operation. Treatment should be continued at a dose of 500 mL daily for an additional two to three days; then, according to the risk of complications, 500 mL may be given every second or third day during the period of risk, for up to two weeks.&#10;&#10;    Infants may be given 5 mL per kg body weight and children 10 mL per kg.&#10;&#10;</field>
		<field name="side_effect">Because of the seriousness of anaphylactoid reactions, it is recommended that the infusion of intravenous dextran be stopped at the first sign of an allergic reaction provided that other means of sustaining the circulation are available. Resuscitative measures should be readily available for emergency administration in the event such a reaction occurs. In circulatory collapse due to anaphylaxis, rapid volume substitutions with an agent other than dextran should be instituted.</field>

		<field name="mode_of_action">Ferrous ascorbate is a synthetic molecule of ascorbic acid and iron. Ferrous ascorbate is a stable complex of iron and ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid plays an important role in movement of plasma iron to storage depots in tissues. There is also evidence that ascorbic acid improves iron utilization, by its reducing action and it may have direct effect on erythropoiesis. This molecule doesn’t dissociate on entering GI Tract due to the stable chelate of iron with ascorbate. There is no action of food inhibitors on it as the complex does not dissociate. Ascorbate is a reducing agent and prevents oxidation. Thus maintains iron in highly soluble ferrous form. &#10;Iron: Essential component in the formation of hemoglobin; adequate amounts of iron are necessary for effective erythropoiesis; also serves as a cofactor of several essential enzymes, including cytochromes that are involved in electron transport.

		<field name="mode_of_action">Aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors in both epithelial (e.g. kidney, GI tract) and nonepithelial (e.g. heart, blood vessels, brain) tissues; causing increases in blood pressure by inducing sodium reabsorption, vascular remodeling, water retention and possibly other mechanisms. Eplerenone is a relatively selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, blocking binding of aldosterone and reducing blood pressure. Eplerenone also appears to have cardioprotective effect in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) after myocardial infarction (MI).</field>
		<field name="interaction">Concomitant use with CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, clarithromycin, diltiazem saquinavir, verpamil, ritonavir) may increase serum concentrations of Eplerenone. CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) may decrease Eplerenone efficacy. Eplerenone may enhance hyperkalaemic effect of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, potassium-sparing diuretics or potassium salts. Concomitant use with diazoxide, MAOIs, pentoxifylline, prostacyclin analogues may enhance hypotensive effect of antihypertensives. NSAIDs may possibly reduce the antihypertensive and/or diuretic effects of potassium-sparing diuretics and may increase risk of hyperkalaemia.

		<field name="mode_of_action">Everolimus, a proliferation signal inhibitor, prevents allograft rejection in rodent and nonhuman primate models of allotransplantation. It exerts its immunosuppressive effect by inhibiting the proliferation and thus, clonal expansion, of antigen-activated T cells which is driven by T cell-specific interleukins eg, interleukin-2 and interleukin-15. Everolimus inhibits an intracellular signaling pathway that normally leads to cell proliferation when triggered by the binding of these T cell growth factors to their receptors. The blockage of this signal by everolimus causes cells to be arrested at the G1 stage of the cell cycle.&#10;&#10;At the molecular level, everolimus forms a complex with the cytoplasmic protein FKBP-12. In the presence of everolimus, the growth factor-stimulated phosphorylation of the p70 S6 kinase is inhibited. Since p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation is under the control of FRAP (also called m-TOR), this finding suggests that the everolimus-FKBP-12 complex binds to and thus, interferes with the function of FRAP. FRAP is a key regulatory protein which governs cell metabolism, growth and proliferation; disabling FRAP function thus explains the cell cycle arrest caused by everolimus.</field>

		<field name="mode_of_action">Ferrous ascorbate is a synthetic molecule of ascorbic acid and iron. Ferrous ascorbate is a stable complex of iron and ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid plays an important role in movement of plasma iron to storage depots in tissues. There is also evidence that ascorbic acid improves iron utilization, by its reducing action and it may have direct effect on erythropoiesis. This molecule doesn’t dissociate on entering GI Tract due to the stable chelate of iron with ascorbate. There is no action of food inhibitors on it as the complex does not dissociate. Ascorbate is a reducing agent and prevents oxidation. Thus maintains iron in highly soluble ferrous form. </field>

		<field name="mode_of_action">Ramipril is a long-acting ACE inhibitor which is metabolised into the active metabolite ramiprilat. Supine and standing blood pressures (BP) are reduced witho reflex tachycardia. Ventricular hypertrophy is reversed and renal blood flow increased. In CHF (CHF), pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure are reduced. Cardiac function is improved. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. It increases excretion of Na and chloride in approx equiv amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of K and bicarbonate. The rationale behind this combination is that these have a synergistic effect in lowering BP and offer an advantage of once-daily dosing convenience.</field>

Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings.&#10;&#10;Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area and under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid.&#10;&#10;Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids.

		<field name="precaution">Imipramine should be used cautiously and with close physician supervision in people, especially the elderly, who have benign prostatic hypertrophy, urinary retention, and glaucoma, especially angle-closure glaucoma. The sedative effect is increased when imipramine is taken with other central nervous system depressants, such as alcoholic beverages, sleeping medications, other sedatives, or antihistamines. Imipramine may increase heart rate and stress on the heart. It may be dangerous for people with cardiovascular disease, especially those who have recently had a heart attack, to take this drug or other antidepressants in the same pharmacological class. Older people and persons with a history of heart disease may develop heart arrhythmias, heart conduction abnormalities, congestive heart failure, heart attack, abnormally rapid heart rates and strokes. Until a therapeutic dosage has been determined, people starting imipramine should be closely watched for signs of suicide. The risk of suicide is increased when imipramine is taken in overdose or combined with alcohol. Manic episodes and the emergence of symptoms of pre-existing psychotic states have been reported when imipramine therapy is started.</field>
		<field name="indication">Depression,Nocturnal enuresis</field>
		<field name="contra_indication">Imipramine should not be given in conjunction with, or within 14 days of treatment with a MAO inhibitor. Combined therapy of this type could lead to the appearance of serious interactions such as hypertensive crises, hyperactivity, hyperpyrexia, spasticity, severe convulsions or coma and death may occur. Imipramine is contraindicated in patients with existing severe hepatic or renal damage, and those with a history of blood dyscrasias. Imipramine is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug or hypersensitivity to tricyclic antidepressants belonging to the dibenzazepine group. Imipramine is contraindicated for use during the acute recovery phase following a myocardial infarction. It should not be used in patients with convulsive disorders or glaucoma. </field>

		<field name="mode_of_action">Insulin lowers blood glucose levels. It regulates carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism by inhibiting hepatic glucose production and lipolysis, and enhancing peripheral glucose disposal. The various insulin formulations are classified according to their durations of action after SC Inj. They are divided into short-, intermediate-, or long-acting insulin. Soluble insulin (also known as &apos;neutral insulin&apos; or &apos;regular insulin&apos;) is a short-acting preparation. &#10;&#10;To extend the duration of action of insulin, preparations are formulated as suspensions in 2 methods. The 1st method involves complexing insulin with a protein so that it is slowly released, e.g. protamine zinc insulin (contains an excess of protamine) and isophane insulin (or NPH insulin which contains equal amounts of protamine and insulin). An alternative method is particle size modification e.g. insulin zinc suspensions. While all the formulations can be admin by SC inj, most by IM inj, only soluble insulin can be admin by IV.

Soluble insulin (also known as &apos;neutral insulin&apos; or &apos;regular insulin&apos;) is a short-acting preparation. &#10;&#10;To extend the duration of action of insulin, preparations are formulated as suspensions in 2 methods. The 1st method involves complexing insulin with a protein so that it is slowly released, e.g. protamine zinc insulin (contains an excess of protamine) and isophane insulin (or NPH insulin which contains equal amounts of protamine and insulin). An alternative method is particle size modification e.g. insulin zinc suspensions. While all the formulations can be admin by SC inj, most by IM inj, only soluble insulin can be admin by IV. Compared to SC inj, IM admin usually has a faster onset of action, with a shorter duration of action.</field>

		<field name="precaution">Patients who develop recurrent nausea or vomiting, unexplained acidosis, or low bicarbonate level while receiving Linzolid should receive immediate medical evaluation. Where administration of Linzolid and concomitant serotonergic agents is clinically appropriate, patients should be closely observed for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome such as cognitive dysfunction, hyperpyrexia, hyper reflexia and incoordination. If signs or symptoms occur physicians should consider discontinuation of either one or both agents. If the concomitant serotonergic agent is withdrawn, discontinuation symptoms can be observed. If patients experience symptoms of visual impairment, such as changes in visual acuity, changes in color vision, blurred vision, or visual field defect, prompt ophthalmic evaluation is recommended. Convulsions have been reported in patients when treated with Linzolid. In some of these cases, a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures was reported.</field>

		<field name="precaution">General&#10;&#10;The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual.&#10;&#10;Since complications of treatment with glucocorticosteroids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.&#10;&#10;Karposis sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement.</field>
		<field name="indication">Cardiac arrest, Multiple sclerosis, Systemic lupus erythematosus, Acute bronchitis, Vestibular neuritis</field>
		<field name="contra_indication">Methylprednisolone acetate is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the product and its constituents.&#10;&#10;Intramuscular corticosteroid preparations are contraindicated for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.&#10;&#10;Methylprednisolone acetate injectable suspension is contraindicated for intrathecal administration. This formulation of methylprednisolone acetate has been associated with reports of severe medical events when administered by this route.&#10;&#10;Methylprednisolone acetate is contraindicated in systemic fungal infections, except when administered as an intra-articular injection for localized joint conditions</field>
		<field name="dose">The initial dosage of parenterally administered Methyl Prednisolone Acetate will vary from 4 to 120 mg, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administration in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages.&#10;&#10;It Should Be Emphasized that Dosage Requirements Are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease Under Treatment and the Response of the Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.&#10;&#10;A. Administration for Local Effect&#10;&#10;1. Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis. The dose for intra-articular administration depends upon the size of the joint and varies with the severity of the condition in the individual patient. In chronic cases, injections may be repeated at intervals ranging from one to five or more weeks, depending upon the degree of relief obtained from the initial injection. The doses in the following table are given as a general guide:&#10;&#10;Large Joint: Knees, Ankles &amp; Shoulders:&#9;20 to 80 mg&#10;Medium joint: Elbows &amp; Wrists:&#9; 10 to 40 mg&#10;Small joint:  Metacarpophalangeal, Interphalangeal, Sternoclavicular &amp; Acromioclavicular:  4 to 10 mg&#10;&#10;2. The dose in the treatment of the various conditions of the tendinous or bursal structures varies with the condition being treated and ranges from 4 to 30 mg. In recurrent or chronic conditions, repeated injections may be necessary.&#10;&#10;3. Injections for Local Effect in Dermatologic Conditions. Following cleansing with an appropriate antiseptic such as 70% alcohol, 20 to 60 mg of the suspension is injected into the lesion. It may be necessary to distribute doses ranging from 20 to 40 mg by repeated local injections in the case of large lesions. &#10;&#10;B. Administration for Systemic Effect&#10;&#10;The intramuscular dosage will vary with the condition being treated. When employed as a temporary substitute for oral therapy, a single injection during each 24-hour period of a dose of the suspension equal to the total daily oral dose of methylprednisolone tablets is usually sufficient. When a prolonged effect is desired, the weekly dose may be calculated by multiplying the daily oral dose by 7 and given as a single intramuscular injection.&#10;&#10;In pediatric patients, the initial dose of methylprednisolone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. Dosage must be individualized according to the severity of the disease and response of the patient. The recommended dosage may be reduced for pediatric patients, but dosage should be governed by the severity of the condition rather than by strict adherence to the ratio indicated by age or body weight.&#10;&#10;In patients with the adrenogenital syndrome, a single intramuscular injection of 40 mg every two weeks may be adequate. For maintenance of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the weekly intramuscular dose will vary from 40 to 120 mg. The usual dosage for patients with dermatologic lesions benefited by systemic corticoid therapy is 40 to 120 mg of methylprednisolone acetate administered intramuscularly at weekly intervals for one to four weeks. In acute severe dermatitis due to poison ivy, relief may result within 8 to 12 hours following intramuscular administration of a single dose of 80 to 120 mg. In chronic contact dermatitis, repeated injections at 5 to 10 day intervals may be necessary. In seborrheic dermatitis, a weekly dose of 80 mg may be adequate to control the condition.&#10;&#10;Following intramuscular administration of 80 to 120 mg to asthmatic patients, relief may result within 6 to 48 hours and persist for several days to two weeks. Similarly, in patients with allergic rhinitis (hay fever), an intramuscular dose of 80 to 120 mg may be followed by relief of coryzal symptoms within six hours persisting for several days to three weeks.&#10;&#10;If signs of stress are associated with the condition being treated, the dosage of the suspension should be increased. If a rapid hormonal effect of maximum intensity is required, the intravenous administration of highly soluble methylprednisolone sodium succinate is indicated.&#10;&#10;In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.&#10;</field>

		<field name="dose">This preparation may be administered by intravenous injection, by intravenous infusion, or by intramuscular injection, the preferred method for initial emergency use being intravenous injection. Following the initial emergency period, consideration should be given to employing a longer acting injectable preparation or an oral preparation.&#10;&#10;When high dose therapy is desired, the recommended dose of Methyl prednisolone sodium succinate Sterile Powder is 30 mg/kg administered intravenously over at least 30 minutes. This dose may be repeated every 4 to 6 hours for 48 hours.&#10;&#10;In general, high dose corticosteroid therapy should be continued only until the patient&apos;s condition has stabilized; usually not beyond 48 to 72 hours.&#10;&#10;In other indications, initial dosage will vary from 10 to 40 mg of methylprednisolone depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administrations in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages.&#10;&#10;It should be emphasized that Dosage Requirements are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease under Treatment and the Response of the Patient.

This solution may then be added to indicate amounts of 5% dextrose in water, isotonic saline solution, or 5% dextrose in isotonic saline solution.&#10;&#10;In pediatric patients, the initial dose of methylprednisolone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.11 to 1.6 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (3.2 to 48 mg/m2bsa/day).&#10;&#10;The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone in pediatric patients whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1–2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. It is further recommended that short course, or &quot;burst&quot; therapy, be continued until the patient achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or until symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.&#10;&#10;Dosage may be reduced for infants and children but should be governed more by the severity of the condition and response of the patient than by age or size. It should not be less than 0.5 mg per kg every 24 hours.&#10;&#10;In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.&#10;</field>

		<field name="mode_of_action">Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine. It exerts sedative and hypnotic, muscle relaxant, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant actions. While the probable anxiolytic action might be as a result of the drug&apos;s ability to increase glycine inhibitory neurotransmitter level, the hypnotic/anaesthetic action may be due to the occupation of the benzodiazepine and GABA receptors leading to membrane hyperpolarisation and neuronal inhibition, and further interfering with the re-uptake of GABA at the synapses.</field>
		<field name="interaction">Increased CNS depression with alcohol, opioids, barbiturates, other sedatives and anaesthetics. Increased respiratory depression with opiates, phenobarbital, other benzodiazepines. Plasma concentrations increased by CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine, erythromycin, clarithromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, ketoconazole and itraconazole, antiretroviral agents, quinupristin with dalfopristin. Midazolam concentration decreased by phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, rifampicin. Halothane, thiopental requirements may be reduced during concurrent use.</field>

Patients with a past history of jaundice, hepatobiliary disease, or peptic ulcer should be observed closely during Niacin therapy. Frequent monitoring of liver function tests and blood glucose should be performed to ascertain that the drug is producing no adverse effects on these organ systems. Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related rise in glucose intolerance, the clinical significance of which is unclear. Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients should be observed closely. Adjustment of diet and/or hypoglycemic therapy may be necessary.&#10;&#10;Caution should also be used when Niacin is used in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of MI, particularly when such patients are also receiving vasoactive drugs such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers or adrenergic blocking agents. Elevated uric acid levels have occurred with Niacin therapy, therefore use with caution in patients predisposed to gout. Niacin has been associated with small but statistically significant dose-related reductions in platelet count and increases in prothrombin time. Caution should be observed when Niacin is administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; prothrombin time and platelet counts should be monitored closely in such patients. Niacin has been associated with small but statistically significant, dose-related reductions in phosphorus levels (mean of -13% with 2000 mg).

		<field name="mode_of_action">Poly ethylene Glycol is an osmotic agent that causes water to be retained with the stool.It appears to have no effect on the active absorption or secretion of glucose or electrolytes.&#10;&#10;Sodium chloride is the major extracellular cation. It is important in electrolyte and fluid balance, osmotic pressure control and water distribution as it restores sodium ions. It is used as a source of electrolytes and water for hydration, treatment of metabolic acidosis, priming solution in haemodialysis and treatment of hyperosmolar diabetes. It is also used as diluents for infusion of compatible drug additives. Potassium chloride is a major cation of the intracellular fluid. It plays an active role in the conduction of nerve impulses in the heart, brain and skeletal muscle; contraction of cardiac skeletal and smooth muscles; maintenance of normal renal function, acid-base balance, carbohydrate metabolism and gastric secretion. Sodium bicarbonate raises blood and urinary pH by dissociation to provide bicarbonate ions, which neutralises the hydrogen ion concentration. It also neutralises gastric acid via production of carbon dioxide.</field>

Potassium chloride should be discontinued immediately and the possibility of ulceration, obstruction, or perforation should be considered if severe vomiting, abdominal pain, distention, or gastrointestinal bleeding occurs.&#10;&#10;Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory evaluations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require the administration of additional electrolyte supplements, or the administration of electrolyte-free dextrose solutions to which individualized electrolyte supplements may be added.&#10;&#10;Certain potassium chloride extended-release tablets contain a wax matrix.

The long-term toxicity of proparacaine is unknown, prolonged use may possibly delay wound healing. Although exceedingly rare with ophthalmic application of local anesthetics, it should be borne in mind that systemic toxicity (manifested by central nervous system stimulation followed by depression) may occur. Protection of the eye from irritating chemicals, foreign bodies and rubbing during the period of anesthesia is very important. Tonometers soaked in sterilizing or detergent solutions should be thoroughly rinsed with sterile distilled water prior to use. Patients should be advised to avoid touching the eye until the anesthesia has worn off.&#10;Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility&#10;&#10;Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenicity, or possible impairment oi fertility in males or females.</field>

The drug appears to be safe for use in patients sensitive to other local anesthetics, but local or systemic sensitivity occasionally occurs. Instillation of proparacaine in the eye at recommended concentration and dosage usually produces little or no initial irritation, stinging, burning, conjunctival redness, lacrimation or increased winking. However, some local irritation and stinging may occur several hours after the instillation. Rarely, a severe immediate-type, apparently hyperallergic corneal reaction may occur which includes acute, intense and diffuse epithelial keratitis; a gray, ground-glass appearance; sloughing of large areas of necrotic epithelium; corneal filaments and, sometimes, iritis with descemetitis.

		<field name="generic_name">Sodium Fusidate</field>
		<field name="precaution">As fusidic acid is metabolized in the liver and excreted mainly through the bile, periodic liver function tests should be carried out in patients with liver dysfunction, abnormalities in the biliary pathway, when fusidic acid is given in high doses for prolonged periods, or when it is given in combination with other antibiotics which have similar excretion pathways eg, lincomycin and rifampicin. In vitro, fusidic acid displaces bilirubin from its albumin-binding site. The clinical significance of this finding is uncertain and kernicterus has not been observed in neonates receiving systemic Fucidin. However, this observation should be borne in mind when fusidic acid is given to preterm, jaundiced, acidotic or seriously ill neonates.&#10;Use in pregnancy &amp; lactation: Animal studies and many years of clinical experience have suggested that Fucidin is devoid of teratogenic effects. Fusidic acid passes the placenta and should be avoided during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy due to the theoretical risk of kernicterus.&#10;Concentrations of fusidic acid found in breast milk are negligible and its use is not contraindicated in nursing mothers.</field>

		<field name="precaution">Mitral stenosis associated with AF. Streptokinase treatment within last 12 mth, use after prolonged or traumatic CPR; diabetic retinopathy. Elderly. Because of the increased likelihood of resistance, due to antistreptokinase antibodies, retreatment with Streptokinase or Streptokinase-containing products may not be effective if administered between five days and twelve months of prior Streptokinase administration or Streptococcal infections, such as Streptococcal pharyngitis, acute rheumatic fever or acute glomerulonephritis secondary to a Streptococcal infection. In principle, no thrombolytic treatment should be commenced before the 10th postoperative day. However, in cases of pulmonary embolism, the indication for earlier treatment may be very strong and after careful consideration of all the risks, Streptokinase may be given before the tenth postoperative day. The danger of bleeding from the operative area must, of course, be taken into account. The danger of haemorrhage is increased by simultaneous or previous treatment with anticoagulants (e.g., Heparin) or substances which inhibit platelet formation or function. If the patient is under active heparinisation, it should be neutralised by the administration of protamine sulphate before the start of thrombolytic therapy.  Repeated Administration After administration of Streptokinase, the titre of antistreptokinase antibodies begins to rise after approximately one week, reaching a peak at 2 to 3 weeks and remains elevated for 8 to 12 months. Because of the increased likelihood of resistance, Streptokinase may not be effective if given during this period.</field>

It induces diuresis by increasing osmotic pressure of the glomerular filtrate and increasing excretion of sodium, potassium and chloride ions. Its osmotic effect also draws water from cells e.g. brain, CSF and anterior chamber of the eye, thereby decreasing intracranial or intraocular pressure. Unlike mannitol, urea penetrates the eye and causes a rebound increase in intraocular pressure if the plasma concentration of the drug is less than that in the vitreous humour. Applied topically, urea promotes hydration of keratin and mild keratolysis in dry skin. It increases water uptake by the stratum corneum and has an antipruritic effect.</field>

		<field name="precaution">Periodic determination of prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) or other suitable coagulation test is essential. Numerous factors, alone or in combination, including travel, changes in diet, environment, physical state and medication may influence response of the patient to anticoagulants. It is generally good practice to monitor the patient&apos;s response with additional PT/INR determination in the period immediately after discharge from the hospital, and whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued or taken irregularly. &#10;&#10;The following factors may exaggerate the effects of warfarin and necessitate a reduction in dosage; loss of weight, elderly subject, acute illness, deficient renal function, decreased dietary intake of vitamin K, administration of certain drugs (see drug interaction). Factors which may call for an increase in maintenance dosage include weight gain, diarrhea and vomiting, increased intake of vitamin K, fats and oils, and the administration of certain drugs (see drug interaction). Careful additional laboratory control is necessary if the patient is to be changed from one formulation to another. Reversal of warfarin anticoagulation by vitamin K takes several days.

Injections should only be made intramuscularly and care should be taken to draw back on the plunger of the syringe before injection in order to be certain that the needle is not in a blood vessel. Intramuscular injections are preferably administered in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm or lateral thigh muscle. The gluteal region should not be used as an injection site because of the risk of injury to the sciatic nerve.&#10;&#10;Chemoprophylaxis against tetanus is neither practical nor useful in managing wounds. Wound cleaning, debridement when indicated, and proper immunization are important.

		<field name="pregnancy_category_id">3</field>
		<field name="mode_of_action">Levodopa is the metabolic precurosor of dopamine, it crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted to dopamine in the brain. Carbidopa increases the amount of levodopa that is transported into the CNS by inhibiting the decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa. Entacapone is a selective inhibitor of catechol-o-methyltransferase. Given concurrently, entacapone results in greater and more substained plasma levels of levodopa, leading to greater control of parkinsonism symptoms.</field>
		<field name="interaction">Increased risk of postural hypotension when used concurrently with hypotensive drugs. Severe orthostatic hypotension may result from concurrent usage with MAOIs. Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, phenytoin or papaverine may reduce the efficacy of levodopa. Iron salts may reduce the bioavailability.

During treatment, these tests should be carried out every 1-2 days until stimulation occurs. Ovarian reaction can also be measured using a cervix index. Close supervision is imperative during treatment. Treatment should be immediately discontinued if unintentional hyperstimulation occurs.&#10;Further remarks concerning the steps to be taken when ovarian hyperstimulation has occurred can be found under Actions.</field>
		<field name="indication">Infertility, Assisted reproductive technologies, Polycystic ovarian disease, In vitro fertilisation procedures</field>
		<field name="contra_indication">Females: Pregnancy, enlargement of the ovaries or cysts that is not caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome, gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause and tumors in the uterus, ovaries and breasts.&#10;Males: Carcinoma of the prostate and tumors in the testes.&#10;The following conditions must be properly treated before therapy with HMG is begun: Dysfunctions of the thyroid gland and of the cortex of the suprarenal gland, a rise in the serum level of prolactin with different causes (hyperprolactinaemia), tumors in the pituitary gland (hypophysis) or in part of the diencephalon (hypothalamus).</field>
		<field name="dose">Unless prescribed otherwise, doses are as follows: Sterility in Females: The dosage of HMG for the induction of follicle growth in normo- or hypogonadotrophic women varies according to the individual. The amount depends on ovarian reaction and should be checked by ultrasound examinations of the ovaries and measuring estradiol levels. If the HMG dosage is too high for the treated individual, multiple uni- and bilateral follicle growth can occur. HMG is administered IM or SC and in general, the therapy is begun with a daily dosage corresponding to 75-150 IU FSH + 75-150 IU LH daily. If the ovaries do not respond, the dosage can slowly be increased until a rise in estradiol secretion and follicle growth is evident. Treatment with the same dosage of HMG continues until the preovulatory estradiol serum level is attained. If the level rises too quickly, the dosage should be reduced. To induce ovulation, hCG 5000 or 10,000 IU are injected IM 1-2 days after the last HMG administration. Note: After administering a HMG dosage which is too high for the corresponding individual, a subsequent hCG administration can cause an unintentional hyperstimulation of the ovaries. Sterility in Males: Initially, 3 x 1000 and 3000 IU hCG a week are administered until a normal testosterone serum level is reached. Then, an additional dose of HMG 3 x (75-150 IU FSH + 75-150 IU LH)/week is administered IM for a few months.</field>
		<field name="side_effect">Occasionally, nausea and vomiting can occur.&#10;In single cases, hypersensitivity reactions and fever can occur during treatment with HMG. The administration of Menogon may lead to reactions at the injection site: Reddening, pain, swelling and itching. In very rare cases, long-term usage can lead to the formation of antibodies, making the therapy ineffective.&#10;Treatment with HMG can often lead to ovarian hyperstimulation that first becomes clinically relevant after the administration of hCG (pregnancy hormone) to induce ovulation. This can lead to the formation of large ovarian cysts that tend to rupture and to intra-abdominal bleeding.&#10;In addition, the accumulation of fluids in the abdominal cavity (ascites), the accumulation of fluids in the chest cavity (hydrothorax), a decrease in the excretion of urine (oliguria), lowering of the blood pressure (hypotension), and occlusion of blood vessels by blood clots (thromboembolic phenomena) can occur. Treatment should be immediately discontinued when the first signs of hyperstimulation appear: Abdominal pain and a palpable (by the physician) enlargement in the lower abdomen, which can be detected sonographically.&#10;If abdominal pain occurs, see the doctor.&#10;With pregnancy, these side effects can intensify, continue over a long period of time, and be life threatening.&#10;Unintentional multiple pregnancies occur more often during treatment with HMG.</field>

		<field name="mode_of_action">Menotrophins, a purified extract of human post-menopausal urine, contain follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) in a ratio of 1:1. The biological effectiveness of menotrophins is mainly due to its FSH content. In the ovaries, the FSH-component increases the quantity of growing follicles and stimulates their development.

		<field name="precaution">Patients should be instructed to drink 8 ounces of clear liquids with each 4-tablet dose of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets. Patients should take a total of 2 quarts of clear liquids with monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets. Inadequate fluid intake, as with any effective purgative, may lead to excessive fluid loss, hypovolemia, and dehydration. Dehydration from purgation may be exacerbated by inadequate oral fluid intake, vomiting, and/or use of diuretics.&#10;&#10;Patients should be instructed not to administer additional laxative or purgative agents, particularly additional sodium phosphate-based purgative or enema products.&#10;&#10;Prolongation of the QT interval has been observed in some patients who were dosed with sodium phosphate colon preparations. QT prolongation with sodium phosphate tablets has been associated with electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets should be used with caution in patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval, since serious complications may occur. Pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs should be considered in patients with known prolonged QT.&#10;&#10;Administration of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets may induce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, since this endoscopic finding was observed with other sodium phosphate cathartic preparations. In the monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets clinical program, aphthous ulcers were observed in 3% of patients who took the 48 gram monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets dosing regimen. This colonoscopic finding should be considered in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease.&#10;&#10;Because published data suggest that sodium phosphate absorption may be enhanced in patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets should be used with caution in such patients.</field>

It is recommended that patients receiving monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets be advised to adequately hydrate before, during, and after the use of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets.  &#10;&#10;Patients should not use monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets for colon cleansing within seven days of previous administration. No additional enema or laxative is required, and patients should be advised NOT to take additional agents, particularly those containing sodium phosphate</field>
		<field name="side_effect">Abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting were the most common adverse events reported with the use of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets.

During therapy, the dose should be decreased if required by the occurrence of adverse events and/or serum IGF-I levels above the age- and gender-specific normal range. Maintenance dosages vary considerably from person to person.&#10;&#10;A lower starting dose and smaller dose increments should be considered for older patients, who are more prone to the adverse effects of somatropin than younger individuals. In addition, obese individuals are more likely to manifest adverse effects when treated with a weight-based regimen. In order to reach the defined treatment goal, estrogen-replete women may need higher doses than men. Oral estrogen administration may increase the dose requirements in women.</field>

		<field name="precaution">Before starting treatment, the couple&apos;s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated.&#10;It should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained eg, ovarian failure, malformation of the sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy or fibroid tumors of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy.&#10;In addition, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency and hyperprolactinemia and, pituitary or hypothalmic tumors, and appropriate specific treatment given.&#10;Patients undergoing follicular growth stimulation are at increased risk of developing hyperstimulation in view of possible excessive oestrogen response and multiple follicular development.&#10;Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can become a serious medical event characterised by large ovarian cysts which are prone to rupture. Excessive ovarian response seldom gives rise to significant hyperstimulation unless hCG is administered to induce ovulation. It is therefore prudent to withhold hCG in such cases and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or use barrier methods for at least 4 days.&#10;Careful monitoring of ovarian response, based on ultrasound is recommended prior to and during stimulation therapy, especially in patients with polycystic ovaries.&#10;In patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception.</field>

		<field name="dose">Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient&apos;s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and estrogen response. A recommended regimen commences at lutropinalpha 75 IU (ie, 1 vial of Luveris) daily with FSH 75-150 IU.&#10;&#10;If an FSH, dose increase is deemed appropriate; dose adaptation should preferably be after 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any 1 cycle to up to 5 weeks.&#10;&#10;When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 5000-10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hrs after the last Luveris and FSH injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration.</field>
		<field name="side_effect">General Description: Lutropin alpha is used for the stimulation of follicular development in association with follitropin alpha. In this context, it is difficult to attribute adverse reactions to any one of the substances used.&#10;There is considerable post-marketing safety experience with human luteinizing hormone (hLH)-containing medicinal products of urinary origin. The safety profile of Luveris is expected to be very similar to that of urine-derived hLH, with the exception of hypersensitivity reactions and application site disorders.&#10;In a clinical trial, mild and moderate injection site reactions (bruising, pain, redness, itching or swelling) were reported in 7.4% and 0.9% of the injections, respectively. No severe injection site reactions were reported. To date, no systemic allergic reactions have been reported following Luveris administration.&#10;Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome was observed in &lt;6% of patients treated with Luveris. No severe OHSS was reported.&#10;Ectopic pregnancy may also occur, especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease.</field>

Adenylate cyclase then activates many other pathways leading to steroid hormone production and other follicle maturation processes.</field>

		<field name="side_effect">Gastrointestinal&#10;&#10;Gastrointestinal side effects have been reported the most frequently. These have included constipation (secondary to aluminum hydroxide therapy) and diarrhea (secondary to magnesium carbonate therapy). &#10;&#10;Patients with renal failure may be at risk of aluminum toxicity because of ingestion of aluminum hydroxide and because of exposure to aluminum-containing water used for dialysate solutions. Adverse effects of aluminum accumulation in these patients has led to monitoring of water source aluminum content by dialysis units and periodic measurements of serum aluminum in patients undergoing chronic dialysis.&#10;&#10;Concurrent administration of aluminum hydroxide with citrate containing products has been associated with unusually high serum concentrations of aluminum and, especially in cases of renal failure, severe toxicity. Citrate may increase aluminum solubility and absorption.&#10;&#10;During long-term use, aluminum has been shown to deposit in bone, joint, and brain.&#10;&#10;Signs and symptoms of hypermagnesemia may include hypotension, nausea, vomiting, EKG changes, respiratory depression, loss of deep tendon reflex, dilated pupils, altered mental status, and coma.&#10;&#10;Metabolic&#10;&#10;Metabolic side effects have included hypophosphatemia with the use of aluminum hydroxide. In patients on long-term aluminum hydroxide therapy, especially in association with poor diets, hypophosphatemia may result in muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis, hemolysis, and encephalopathy.&#10;&#10;Osteomalacia due to aluminum deposition in bone is generally only seen in patients with chronic renal failure. Bone formation slows in response to aluminum bone deposits. Aluminum may also deposit in joint tissue, resulting in arthropathy and hydrarthrosis.&#10;&#10;Musculoskeletal side effects have included osteomalacia, due to aluminum hydroxide, which may occur by two different mechanisms. Osteomalacia may occur due to hypophosphatemia or due to aluminum accumulation in bone. Osteomalacia due to hypophosphatemia is often accompanied by malaise, bone pain, muscular weakness, and bone fractures. Osteomalacia due to aluminum deposition may present in a similar fashion and occurs predominately in patients with chronic renal failure. Aluminum deposits typically can be observed on bone biopsy.&#10;Nervous system&#10;&#10;Encephalopathy associated with aluminum accumulation is characterized by speech disorders, dysarthria, dyspraxia, dysphasia, tremor, myoclonus, seizures, coma, and ultimately death. EEG of patients with aluminum encephalopathy may show paroxysmal slowing and diffuse rhythmical bursts of delta activity.&#10;Renal&#10;&#10;Renal side effects have rarely included formation of renal calculi, most probably due to hypercalciuria, with the use of aluminum hydroxide.&#10;</field>

Therefore, the vaccine should only be given to those who have a considerable risk of acquiring yellow fever.&#10;Because IM injection can cause injection site haematoma, Stamaril should not be given by the IM route to persons with any bleeding disorder, eg, haemophilia or thrombocytopenia, or to persons on anticoagulant therapy.

		<field name="dose">Primary Vaccination: Adults and Children &gt;9 months: 0.5 mL of reconstituted vaccine administered as a single dose.&#10;&#10;Children &lt;9 months: The vaccine must not be given to children &lt;6 months. Vaccination against yellow fever is not usually recommended in children aged from 6 months up to 9 months except in specific circumstances and in accordance with available official recommendations, in which case, the dose is the same as in older children and adults.&#10;&#10;The vaccine should be given at least 10 days before entering an endemic area since protective immunity may not be achieved until at least this time has elapsed.&#10;&#10;Elderly: The dose is the same as for adults. However, due to a higher risk of yellow fever vaccine-associated severe and potentially fatal disease in persons from 60 years of age, the vaccine should only be given when it is considered that there is a considerable and unavoidable risk of acquiring yellow fever infection.&#10;&#10;Re-Vaccination: Re-vaccination with 1 dose of 0.5mL is recommended every 10 years in persons considered to be at risk of exposure. International Health Regulations (IHR) require re-vaccination, using the same dose as for primary vaccination, at intervals of 10 years in order to retain a valid certificate.&#10;&#10;For IM use, the recommended injection sites are the anterolateral aspect of the thigh in the infants and toddlers (6 months up to 2 years of age) and the deltoid muscle in older children and adults.&#10;</field>

Long-term antibiotic use can interfere with biotin production in the intestine and increase the risk of deficiency symptoms, such as dermatitis, depression, hair loss, anemia, and nausea. Long-term use of anti-seizure medications may also lead to biotin deficiency. Biotin deficiency results in fatigue, depression, nausea, muscle pains, hair loss, and anemia.

Prevention of the RANKL/RANK interaction inhibits osteoclast formation, function and survival. Denosumab therefore reduces bone resorption and increases bone mass and strength in both cortical and trabecular bone.</field>

May activate mania/hypomania, caution in patients with history or family history of mania or hypomania. Caution in patients with pre-existing glaucoma, hypertension, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or lipid metabolism and seizure disorders. Sustained elevations in blood pressure have been reported. May be associated with dose-related increase in serum total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides. May increase risk of bleeding. &#10;&#10;May be associated with development of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) and Hyponatraemia, elderly and patients who are taking diuretics or with volume depletion may be at greater risk. Interstitial lung disease and eosinophilic pneumonia associated with venlafaxine (the parent drug of desvenlafaxine) have been reported.

		<field name="pregnancy_category_id">3</field>
		<field name="mode_of_action">Desvenlafaxine, the major active metabolite of venlafaxine, is a potent and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Clinical efficacy of desvenlafaxine is thought to be related with the drug&apos;s potentiation of serotonergic and noradrenergic activity in the CNS. It does not have monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitory activity; and has not shown significant affinity for muscarinic cholinergic, H1-histaminergic, ?-adrenergic, dopaminergic, ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, and opiate receptors in vitro. At concentrations that inhibit serotonin and norephinephrine reuptake, inhibition of dopamine reuptake appears to be unlikely.</field>
		<field name="interaction">Desvenlafaxine may diminish the therapeutic effect of Iobenguane I-123. May enhance adverse effects of other CNS depressants. Sibutramine and MAOI may enhance the serotonergic effect of Desvenlafaxine; increase risk of development of serotonin syndrome. Concomitant use with alpha-/beta-agonists may enhance tachycardic and vasopressor effect. Desvenlafaxine may increase concentration of CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. desipramine); decrease exposure of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. midazolam). CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) may increase concentration of desvenlafaxine. May enhance the antiplatelet effect of nonselective NSAIDs, aspirin; and anticoagulant effect of warfarin.&#10;Potentially Fatal: Concurrent use with MAOIs may lead to fatal serotonin syndrome or NMS-like reactions. Do not use within at least 14 days of discontinuing MAOI treatment and start MAOI at least 7 days after stopping desvenlafaxine. Increased risk of serotonin syndrome with sibutramine.</field>

A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of anti-epileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. Therefore, patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.&#10;Nervous system disorders&#10;Eslicarbazepine acetate has been associated with some central nervous system adverse reactions, such as dizziness and somnolence, which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury.&#10;Oral contraceptives&#10;Eslicarbazepine acetate may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Additional non-hormonal forms of contraception are recommended&#10;Other warnings and precautions&#10;If Eslicarbazepine is to be discontinued it is recommended to withdraw it gradually to minimise the potential of increased seizure frequency.&#10;Concomitant use of eslicarbazepine acetate with oxcarbazepine is not recommended because this may cause overexposure to the active metabolites.&#10;Hyponatraemia&#10;Hyponatraemia has been reported as an adverse reaction in 1.2% of patients treated with Eslicarbazepine. Hyponatraemia is asymptomatic in most cases, however, it may be accompanied by clinical symptoms like worsening of seizures, confusion, decreased consciousness. Frequency of hyponatraemia increased with increasing eslicarbazepine acetate dose. In patients with pre-existing renal disease leading to hyponatraemia, or in patients concomitantly treated with medicinal products which may themselves lead to hyponatraemia (e.g. diuretics, desmopressin, carbamazepine), serum sodium levels should be examined before and during treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate. Furthermore, serum sodium levels should be determined if clinical signs of hyponatraemia occur. Apart from this, sodium levels should be determined during routine laboratory examination. If clinically-relevant hyponatraemia develops, eslicarbazepine acetate should be discontinued.&#10;PR interval&#10;Prolongations in PR interval have been observed in clinical studies with eslicarbazepine acetate.&#10;Caution should be exercised in patients with medical conditions (e.g. low levels of thyroxine, cardiac conduction abnormalities), or when taking concomitant medicinal products known to be associated with PR prolongation.&#10;Renal impairment&#10;Caution should be exercised in the treatment of patients with renal impairment and the dose should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance. In patients with CLCR &lt;30 ml/min use is not recommended due to insufficient data.&#10;Hepatic impairment&#10;As clinical data are limited in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and pharmacokinetic and clinical data are missing in patients with severe hepatic impairment, eslicarbazepine acetate should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.&#10;</field>

		<field name="mode_of_action">Insulin lowers blood glucose levels. It regulates carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism by inhibiting hepatic glucose production and lipolysis, and enhancing peripheral glucose disposal. The various insulin formulations are classified according to their durations of action after SC Inj. They are divided into short-, intermediate-, or long-acting insulin. Soluble insulin (also known as &apos;neutral insulin&apos; or &apos;regular insulin&apos;) is a short-acting preparation. To extend the duration of action of insulin, preparations are formulated as suspensions in 2 methods. The 1st method involves complexing insulin with a protein so that it is slowly released, e.g. protamine zinc insulin (contains an excess of protamine) and isophane insulin (or NPH insulin which contains equal amounts of protamine and insulin). An alternative method is particle size modification e.g. insulin zinc suspensions. While all the formulations can be admin by SC inj, most by IM inj, only soluble insulin can be admin by IV. Compared to SC inj, IM admin usually has a faster onset of action, with a shorter duration of action.</field>

		<field name="precaution">Hypoglycaemia&#10;Omission of a meal or unplanned strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. Concomitant illness, especially infections and fever, usually increases the patient&apos;s insulin requirement. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or diseases affecting the adrenal, pituitary or thyroid gland may require changes in the insulin dose.&#10;&#10;&#10;Hyperglycaemia&#10;Administration of rapid-acting insulin is recommended in situations with severe hyperglycaemia. Inadequate dosing and/or discontinuation of treatment in patients requiring insulin may lead to hyperglycaemia and potentially to diabetic ketoacidosis. Furthermore, concomitant illness, especially infections, may lead to hyperglycaemia and thereby cause an increased insulin requirement.&#10;&#10;Eye disorder&#10;Intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy, while long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy.&#10;&#10;Avoidance of accidental mix-ups&#10;Patients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental mix-ups between Ryzodeg and other insulin products.&#10;&#10;Older patients (? 65 years old)&#10;Ryzodeg can be used in older patients.

When needed, the patient can change the time of administration as long as this insulin is dosed with the largest meal when taken once daily.&#10;In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus this insulin can be administered alone, in combination with oral anti-diabetic medicinal products, and in combination with bolus insulin.&#10;In type 1 diabetes mellitus, this insulin is combined with short-/rapid-acting insulin at the remaining meals.&#10;This is to be dosed in accordance with the individual patient’s needs. Dose-adjustments are recommended to be primarily based on fasting plasma glucose measurements.&#10;&#10;Initiation&#10;Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus&#10;The recommended total daily starting dose is 10 units with meal(s) followed by individual dosage adjustments.&#10;Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus&#10;The recommended starting dose is 60–70% of the total daily insulin requirements.

Continuous rotation of the injection site within the particular injection area may help to reduce the risk of developing these reactions.&#10;Injection site reactions&#10;Injection site reactions (including injection site haematoma, pain, haemorrhage, erythema, nodules, swelling, discolouration, pruritus, warmth and injection site mass) occurred in patients treated with&#10;Ryzodeg.

		<field name="pregnancy_category_id">16</field>
		<field name="mode_of_action">When indacaterol and glycopyrronium are administered together in this Breezhaler, they provide additive efficacy due to their different mode of action targeting different receptors and pathways to achieve small muscle relaxation. Due to the differential density of ?2-adrenoceptors and M3-receptors in central versus smaller airways, ?2-agonists should be more effective in relaxing small airways while an anticholinergic compound may be more effective in large airways. Thus, for optimal bronchodilation in all regions of the human lung, a combination of a ?2-adrenergic agonist and a muscarinic antagonist may be beneficial.&#10;Indacaterol: Indacaterol is an &apos;ultra&apos; long-acting ?2-adrenergic agonist for once-daily administration. The pharmacological effects of ?2-adrenoceptor agonists, including indacaterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3&apos;, 5&apos;-adenosine monophosphate (AMP, cyclic monophosphate). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. In vitro studies have shown that indacaterol has &gt;24-fold greater agonist activity at ?2-receptors compared to ?1-receptors and 20-fold greater agonist activity compared to ?3-receptors. This selectivity profile is similar to formoterol.&#10;When inhaled, indacaterol acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. Indacaterol is a nearly full agonist at the human ?2-adrenergic receptor with nanomolar potency. In isolated human bronchus, indacaterol has a rapid onset of action and a long duration of action.&#10;Glycopyrronium: Glycopyrronium is an inhaled long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (anticholinergic) for once-daily maintenance bronchodilator treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Parasympathetic nerves are the major bronchoconstrictive neural pathway in airways and cholinergic tone is the key reversible component of airflow obstruction in COPD. Glycopyrronium works by blocking the bronchoconstrictor action of acetylcholine on airway smooth muscle cells, thereby dilating the airways.&#10;</field>

		<field name="mode_of_action">Tetracyclines provide bacteriostatic action at the available plasma and tissue concentrations and are effective against intracellular and extracellular organisms. Their mechanism of action is based on an inhibition of ribosomal protein synthesis. Tetracyclines block the access of the bacterial aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex by binding to the 30S subunit of the ribosome, thus preventing the addition of amino acids to the growing peptide chain in protein synthesis. When given at therapeutically attainable concentrations their toxic effect is limited to the bacterial cells.&#10;&#10;The exact mechanisms by which tetracyclines reduce lesions of acne vulgaris have not been fully elucidated; however, the effect appears to result in part from the antibacterial activity of the drugs. Following oral administration, the drugs inhibit the growth of susceptible organisms (mainly Propionibacterium acnes) on the surface of the skin and reduce the concentration of free fatty acids in sebum. The reduction in free fatty acids in sebum may be an indirect result of the inhibition of lipase-producing organisms which convert triglycerides into free fatty acids or may be a direct result of interference with lipase production in these organisms. Free fatty acids are comedogenic and are believed to be a possible cause of the inflammatory lesions, e.g. papules, pustules, nodules, cysts, of acne. &#10;&#10;However, other mechanisms also appear to be involved because clinical improvement of acne vulgaris with oral tetracycline therapy does not necessarily correspond with a reduction in the bacterial flora of the skin or a decrease in the free fatty acid content of sebum.</field>

		<field name="mode_of_action">Aciclovir is a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue with inhibitory activity against Herpes simplex viruses type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) in cell culture and in vivo. The inhibitory activity of Aciclovir is highly selective due to its affinity for the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by HSV. This viral enzyme converts Aciclovir into Aciclovir monophosphate, a nucleotide analogue. The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes. &#10;&#10;In cell culture, Aciclovir Triphosphate stops replication of herpes viral DNA. This inhibition is accomplished in 3 ways: 1) competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase, 2) incorporation into and termination of the growing viral DNA chain, and 3) inactivation of the viral DNA polymerase. &#10;&#10;Hydrocortisone is the main glucocorticoid secreted by the adrenal cortex. It is used topically for its anti-inflammatory effects which suppress the clinical manifestations of the disease in a wide range of disorders where inflammation is a prominent feature.&#10;</field>
