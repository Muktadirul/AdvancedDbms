		<field name="details">  “Suicide Prevention and Addiction” will be presented on Tuesday December 16, 2014; 7:30 pm to 9:00 pm; by Raymond Dalton, MA, CAADC; Dawn Farm Outpatient Program Coordinator. There is an alarmingly high prevalence of suicide among people with addiction and people in early recovery, and the period of early recovery from addiction is especially high risk. Family, friends and professionals are often strategically positioned to recognize potential suicidal thinking and intervene to help. This program will raise awareness of the signs of suicidal thinking and describe ways to offer support and obtain help for people who may be contemplating suicide. Participants will learn how to recognize suicidal thinking, reach out and offer support to others contemplating suicide, obtain help when suicidal thoughts are present, and access local and national suicide prevention and intervention resources. This program is part of the Dawn Farm Education Series, a FREE, annual education series developed to provide accurate, helpful, hopeful, practical, current information about chemical dependency, recovery, family and related issues; and to dispel the myths, misinformation, secrecy, shame and stigma that prevent chemically dependent individuals and their families from getting help and getting well. The Education Series is designed to help people with alcoholism or other drug addictions to achieve, maintain and strengthen their recovery; assist family members and friends to understand and support recovery in people they care about as well as maintain their own health and well-being; aid professionals and students in various disciplines to work effectively with people with addictions and their families and support their recovery process; and contribute to a community culture supportive of recovery. All programs are free and open to anyone interested.  Registration is not required. 1.5 hours of free C.E. approved by NAADAC (National Association for Addiction Professionals) and MCBAP (Michigan Certification Board for Addiction Professionals) is offered for each program. A certificate to document attendance is provided on request. The Education Series is organized by Dawn Farm, a non-profit community of programs providing a continuum of chemical dependency services. For information, please contact Mark Albulov LLMSW, Dawn Farm Education Series Coordinator, at 734-485-8725 or info@dawnfarm.org, or see http://www.dawnfarm.org/programs/education-series.  </field>

		<field name="details">  &#10;&#10;The 2015 Human Amyloid Imaging Conference will continue to emphasize ample lively discussion of core controversies such as: what does the presence of brain amyloid mean, how should it be measured, how does it change, and what does it portend?  Our discussions will primarily spring from brief presentations by active investigators who will report unpublished, cutting-edge research in human imaging of amyloid-beta and/or other biomarkers that pertain to Alzheimer&apos;s-related disease. To assemble at HAI only the most recent, important work, abstract submissions will be again accepted and peer-reviewed less than two months prior to the meeting.&#10;&#10;The 2014 meeting drew close to 300 attendees and showcased 67 posters from approximately 20 research groups from the North America, Europe, South East Asia, and Australia. Meeting Programs from past years are accessible from the event page.&#10;&#10;Research reports are complemented at HAI by Keynote presentations that are intended to cross disciplines and provide perspective from neuropathology, neurochemistry, psychology, neurology, molecular imaging, clinical trials and biomarker research. In 2015, we are pleased to welcome two such presentations from Dennis Dickson, MD (Mayo Clinic) and Ann McKee, MD (Boston University). In addition to these, we will continue our lectures on basic methods in amyloid PET.  </field>

Genetic events resulting in inappropriate activation of this pathway are common in many cancers and, as a result, are a focus of both basic cancer research and drug discovery efforts in oncology.&#10;&#10;The PI3K-Akt-mTOR network also controls diverse aspects of inflammation and adaptive immunity. Although originally modeled as an independent and linear signaling cascade, today it is evident that the PI3K pathway also functions as a central hub for cross-talk in both vertical as well as reciprocal feedback regulation with other important signaling pathways. How metabolic pathways are regulated to meet the unique needs of tumor cells and activated lymphocytes is a fertile area of study, with mounting evidence that metabolic regulation is intimately linked with the signal transduction pathways that control cell growth and proliferation.&#10;&#10;One of the exciting advances in the field is the development of new inhibitors against this pathway. However, the rationale for inhibiting individual or multiple isoforms of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling remains a subject of intense debate.&#10;&#10;This meeting aims to bring together scientists and clinicians from academia and industry to discuss the opportunities and liabilities of targeting the PI3K- and related pathways in disease, drawing on human pathophysiology and genetics, preclinical models and clinical data with PI3K pathway inhibitors. A joint meeting on Integrating Metabolism and Tumor Biology will enhance opportunities for interdisciplinary interactions.   </field>

Pressures on food sources are predicted to reach a critical state in a few decades resulting in food shortages, especially in the developing world. While there is a long history of using vaccination to control animal diseases, the most notable success being the eradication of rinderpest, there are many important diseases for which no effective vaccines are available.&#10;&#10;Advances in genomic technologies, coupled with improved knowledge of the cellular and molecular events involved in the immune response, provide exciting new opportunities for vaccine development. However, effective exploitation of these advances needs to be based on an understanding of the immune responses that mediate effective immunity against the target pathogens.&#10;&#10;While laboratory animal models have proved invaluable in elucidating fundamental immunological principles, the results of vaccination studies have often failed to translate to larger animal species and humans. Hence, there is a need to study the target diseases in their natural hosts. Animals also provide valuable experimental models for studies of zoonotic pathogens that cause disease in both animals and humans (e.g. TB and influenza), as well as closely related pathogens that cause similar diseases in animals and humans.&#10;&#10;This meeting seeks to highlight the value of studying immune responses to infectious disease in animals not only to develop control measures for animal diseases but also to advance knowledge that may be more widely applicable for vaccine development. Understanding the immune response in veterinary species holds the promise of accelerating vaccine development for food animals, companion pets and clearly humans, directly addressing the One World, One Health concept emerging in vaccine research.   </field>

Granulomas form when the immune system attempts to wall off substances that it perceives as foreign but is unable to eliminate. These substances include infectious organisms such as bacteria and fungi as well as other known foreign materials. In some cases however, the offending antigen is unknown as in sarcoidosis. A granuloma is therefore a special type of inflammation, typically an organized collection of macrophages that occurs in a wide variety of infectious and non-infectious diseases including schistosomiasis, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, Crohn’s disease, sarcoidosis, and rheumatoid arthritis.&#10;&#10;The goal of this Keystone Symposia meeting on Granulomas in Infectious and Non-Infectious Diseases is to bring together researchers, clinicians, and members of the pharmaceutical industry to discuss the basic mechanics of granuloma formation, elucidate common pathogenic mechanisms, and identify novel areas of therapeutic intervention for the large number of chronic granulomatous diseases.    </field>

		<field name="details">  Viruses are the most numerous biological entities on the planet, found in every environmental niche that is compatible with life. Viruses are associated with disease and historically the study of viruses has been instrumental in the development of modern biochemistry. The global distribution of viruses is vast, from the upper atmosphere to hot spring environments, and viruses are huge repositories for global genetic diversity.&#10;&#10;The study of viruses over the last decade has broadened in a revolutionary manner to include fields as diverse as biomedicine (diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines) and materials science (with advanced materials for catalysis, computer memory, and battery applications). With continued growth of the technology development pipeline, large-scale nanomanufacturing of virus-based materials has become a key requirement, transitioning the physical virology from basic science to engineering disciplines. Much of this rapid expansion is a result of a very strong foundation in the area of structural virology, which has allowed structure-based design and synthesis.&#10;&#10;Advances in bioinformatics and sequencing technologies have allowed disciplines outside of traditional virology to take advantage of the ability of viruses to amplify populations from a single unique virus particle and therefore screen for selective phenotypes well beyond the normal biology of any virus.&#10;&#10;Theory and computational approaches are increasingly able to tackle these large macromolecular systems and the development of new analytical tools and a growing appreciation of the importance of the mechanical properties of these are biological architectures all coalesce to make this an exciting intersection between a wide range of disciplines. There are new expanding frontiers in Physical Virology that build strongly on the traditional approaches but are forging new directions with important applications in medicine and the design, engineering, and nanomanufacturing of new materials across a range of length scales with impacts in human health and the environment.  </field>

		<field name="details">  &#10;&#10;Macromolecules of RNA have intrinsically defined features at the nanometer scale and can serve as powerful building blocks for the bottom-up fabrication of nanostructures and nanodevices. The hallmarks of RNA nanotechnology include:&#10;&#10;(1) use of RNA as a nanomaterial to build homogeneous structures with defined structure and stoichiometry; this pioneering concept first demonstrated by conference chair, Peixuan Guo in 1998 has now created an unexpected paradigm of materials engineering and synthetic structural biology. This concept is fundamentally different from molecular biology studies of RNA, which is not classified as nanotechnology.&#10;(2) As an alternative to DNA, RNA has recently catapulted into place as a nanotechnology platform due to its diversity in both structure and function. RNA is unique in comparison to DNA by virtue of its higher thermodynamic stability, canonical and noncanonical base pairing ability, as well as a variety of single stranded loops suitable for inter- and intra-molecular interactions, base stacking, and distinct in vivo attributes.&#10;(3) While the studies on RNA structure and folding can be dated decades ago, RNA nanotechnology is a unique field that is distinct from the classical studies of RNA structure and folding. Besides intra-molecular (within a molecule) interaction and folding, the special knowledge of inter-molecular (between molecules) interaction is necessary.&#10;(4) RNA nanoparticles can be purified to homogeneity and can be characterized or visualized by either chemical, physical, biophysical, or optical procedures.&#10;(5) Previously, the sensitivity of RNA to RNase degradation had been the biggest hurdle in the production of RNA for use as a construction material. Recently, simple chemical modifications, such as that with 2’-fluorine, have led to the generation of certain RNAs resistant to degradation, without changing their folding property and even their ability to retain their biological function in certain cases.&#10;(6) Finally, simply conjugating functional RNA modules to gold, liposome, dendrimer or polymer based nanoparticles does not constitute RNA nanotechnology; rather, RNA nanotechnology is bottom-up approaches to assemble nanometer scale particles with its main constituent composed of RNA.&#10;&#10;The driving force motivating the establishment of this conference arises from the successful organization of two international conferences on RNA nanotechnology and Therapeutics in 2010 and 2013, which brought together about 200 scientists from 15 countries. This conference will encourage a cross-disciplinary approach to RNA nanotechnology research and specifically foster collaborations between scientists and engineers working in the diverse fields of chemistry, biochemistry, structural biology, microbiology, cancer biology, cell biology, biophysics, pharmacy, materials, and nanotechnology. The intent of this GRC is to promote transformative advances that will enable the monitoring and improvement of human health and the diagnosis and treatment of diseases utilizing the unique modality provided by RNA-based nanoparticles.&#10;&#10;Because of the success of the first two conferences, one can fully expect that this new GRC will attract a wide audience of outstanding scientists. The prestigious name of the Gordon Conferences will raise the profile of the topic to many other scientists who are working in this or related fields, but have not participated in previous meetings. Participants, organizers, and keynote speakers of the past RNA Nanotechnology and Therapeutics conferences have agreed that a bi-annual conference is needed to respond to the significant interest generated by previous meetings, and to effectively foster further cross-fertilization to advance the field.  </field>

The past decade or so has seen the translation of our fundamental understanding of the immune response into clinical studies, with some success and also some failures. These clinical outcomes, coupled with more sophisticated techniques available to interrogate the human immune response, allow us to reassess and further explore pathways that are driving autoimmune disease.&#10;&#10;In this symposium, we cover the pathways in immunity and tolerance that lead to loss of immunological control, dysregulated immune responses and chronic inflammatory disease. We cover preclinical and clinical aspects of a diverse number of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases including Lupus, Multiple Sclerosis, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Psoriasis, Transplantation and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Each session is designed to include a basic research talk followed by a mechanistic talk on mouse and human and clinical translation.   </field>

New technologies together with this new knowledge has given birth to the next generation of vaccines, adoptive cellular therapies, and T cell modulating agents, all of which are being investigated in preclinical models and in patients.&#10;&#10;This new era has also revealed the complex network of signaling pathways within the tumor microenvironment that currently favors the procarcinogenic process, but new evidence also demonstrates that this process can be altered with agents that modulate these pathways resulting in antitumor immunity.&#10;&#10;Much is being learned about the interdependency of these pathways with each other and with the non-immune cellular components within the tumor microenvironment that include the tumor, epithelial and endothelial cells, and the stroma. Thus, optimizing outcomes for patients will likely come from successfully combining immunotherapies with each other and with other classes of therapies. This will require the integration of different scientific approaches from small molecule targeted therapies to complex biologics, as well as addressing molecular pathways in all of the cell subtypes within the tumor microenvironment.&#10;&#10;This conference will bring together experts from academia and industry, who have pioneered these areas of immunologic science, and will showcase the integration of this increasingly complicated knowledge being uncovered in this field of research into rapid translation into clinical applications.   </field>

		<field name="details">  Since its inception, the GRC on Cilia, Mucus, and Mucociliary Interactions has provided a unique forum that brings together researchers from multiple closely related disciplines. Topics revolve around the latest information on basic mechanisms of cellular assembly, processing, and function, and the relationship between motile cilia, mucus and related features that are an essential component of fundamental biological processes. As such, issues related to multiple disciplines are embraced. The result is a highly integrated, international gathering of basic scientists, bioengineers, translational investigators, and clinicians who study the components of the mucociliary apparatus, the fundamentals of cilia and mucus biology, and their interface. We will continue the tradition of featuring cutting-edge research of motile cilia and mucus as related to diseases including cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma, and COPD, as well as heterotaxy and congenital heart disease. The 2015 meeting will address specific gaps in our knowledge such as:&#10;&#10;- What are the cellular and molecular origins of newly identified genetic and acquired dysfunction of cilia, mucin and mucus?&#10;- How can we image components, functions and interactions of cilia and mucus at the molecular level with high resolution?&#10;- How do defects in mucus and cilia impact mucosal immunity?&#10;- As we translate basic discoveries, what diagnostic and therapeutic approaches can monitor and correct defects?&#10;&#10;The meeting will open with keynote talks from eminent scientists who will detail the current state-of-the-art and paradigms, and articulate the key challenges for the future, while subsequent sessions will focus on specific issues in the field. For each session, discussion leaders will provide a brief introduction and perspective on the topics to be covered. Established and up-and- coming scientists will present new unpublished data, as is the tradition of GRCs.&#10;&#10;Sessions will include speakers from inside and outside the field. We also include an evening of &quot;late breaking science&quot; composed of six talks selected from submitted abstracts. In addition to the platform presentations, afternoon poster sessions with &quot;poster rounds&quot; will highlight exceptional work and enhance investigator-trainee discussions. Abstracts from young investigators and trainees selected for short talks or with highlighted posters will be awarded travel grants.  </field>

Due to enormous functional and structural diversity of lipids as well as because of their complex regulation at multiple spatial and temporal scales, lipids need to be studied not only at the level of biological pathways but also at the level of the biophysical systems they are part of including cellular membranes or lipoprotein particles. From the perspective of systems biology, this adds an additional but necessary layer of complexity to the studies of lipids.&#10;&#10;This meeting will cover recent progress and perspectives in the studies of lipids as related to:&#10;&#10;1) Cellular, as well as, systemic lipid metabolism;&#10;2) Computational modeling of lipids; and&#10;3) Role of lipids in the pathogenesis of several complex diseases including metabolic, immune and central nervous system disorders as well as cancer.&#10;&#10;Specifically, experts in this area will address whether alterations in lipid biology may be an important underlying pathogenic link among these disorders, which could explain the well documented metabolic co-morbidities such as between obesity and several other complex diseases.&#10;&#10;The meeting will bring together a highly interdisciplinary outstanding group of scientists including biochemists, molecular and cellular biologists, clinical researchers and computational biologists. Such a diverse setting will facilitate the cross-disciplinary interactions needed to address current key questions in lipid biology in the context of translational medicine as well as move the field of lipids forward by consolidating the use of system approaches to study their involvement in the pathogenesis of common diseases.   </field>

		<field name="details">  The 2015 Gordon Research Conference on Cardiac Arrhythmia Mechanisms will provide a forum in which cutting edge concepts and new observations on mechanisms and treatment of complex cardiac rhythm disturbances are discussed, at levels of integration ranging from molecule to the patient. The meeting will focus on key scientific discoveries, relevant to both basic science and the clinic, emphasizing multi-disciplinary approaches to integrating the latest (and, to a large extent, unpublished) advances in structural biology, genomics, proteomics, stem cell research, cellular and tissue electrophysiology, high-resolution electro-mechanical mapping, and computational modeling to study of the hetero-cellular nature of cardiac arrhythmogenesis and anti-arrhythmic therapy.&#10;&#10;This represents an exceptional opportunity for bringing together an internationally leading selection of outstanding investigators who are experts in various relevant fields, including biologists, geneticists, electrophysiologists, biophysicists, biomedical engineers, mathematical biologists, computer scientists, and clinical cardiologists to interact in an informal atmosphere and share ideas about the ‘multi-physics’ nature of mechanisms underlying normal and disturbed heart rhythms, including causes of sudden cardiac death.&#10;&#10;The Specific Aims of the conference are the following:&#10;&#10;- To bring together established and young investigators who study the mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias from interdisciplinary perspectives.&#10;- To assess our current understanding of cardiac arrhythmia mechanisms, emphasizing systems approaches which integrate information across multiple scales, from multiple cell types, obtained using a broad range of techniques, to project from gene and molecule to cell, tissue, organ, and organism, including human, using integrated experimental and computational methods.&#10;- To highlight neglected areas in our understanding of cardiac arrhythmia mechanisms and to identify and prioritize novel research directions.&#10;- To use the critical mass of attendee excellence to improve existing strategies and develop innovative new approaches to treating and preventing cardiac arrhythmias as a leading cause of death in our society.&#10;- To bridge the real or perceived divides between levels of investigation, foci of cardiac activity (e.g. electrics and mechanics), employment backgrounds (academia, hospital, industry), geographies, gender, ethnicity or age groups, and thus to consolidate the cardiac arrhythmia research community with the view of enhanced collaboration and, ultimately, success.  </field>

Classic disease examples include disorders of metabolism such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which are often associated with co-morbidities including non-alcoholic liver disease and coronary, peripheral and central vascular disease. Collectively the spectrum of disorders is often referred to as the metabolic syndrome.&#10;&#10;Over the past decade, it has become evident that shifts in cellular metabolism are often linked to changes in the number, morphology, and function of mitochondria, and that these cellular changes underlie systemic metabolic abnormalities that characterize the many clinical features of the metabolic syndrome.&#10;&#10;This meeting will discuss novel findings that link mitochondrial function in peripheral tissues, such as liver, muscle and gut, with the systemic abnormalities of the metabolic syndrome. The potential for identifying new therapeutics that are based on modifying mitochondrial function will be reviewed. As mitochondrial function is now acknowledged to also control metabolic homeostasis on an organismal level in addition to controlling energy homeostasis at the cellular level this meeting will create a truly interdisciplinary environment that brings together basic scientists in the fields of bioenergetics, mitochondrial and cell biology, physiology and clinicians with an interest in metabolic disease, to foster innovative ideas in this area.   </field>

For example, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects over 25% of the US population and has become the most common cause of liver failure and transplantation. NAFLD is also linked to the development of major metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Despite the central role of the liver in whole-body energy metabolism and its contribution to disease development, there are literally no dedicated meetings that focus on the cellular and mechanistic aspects of the regulation of liver metabolism.&#10;&#10;This meeting will bring together experts, both basic scientists and clinicians, across diverse fields including biochemistry, cell biology, genetics, hepatology, nutrition, physiology and virology to exclusively focus on the liver and bridge a translational divide. Meeting themes will center on regulation of hepatic energy metabolism, crosstalk between the liver and different organs and cell types and how alterations in macronutrient metabolism contribute to disease etiology.&#10;&#10;The objectives of this conference are to:&#10;1) Expose scientists across diverse disciplines to different aspects of hepatic metabolism and NAFLD development;&#10;2) Find synergies in research efforts to expedite our understand hepatic energy metabolism;&#10;3) Explore emerging metabolic targets for therapeutic interventions to prevent or alleviate NAFLD and related comorbidities.   </field>

The additive or synergistic effect of combination therapy fully lowers blood pressure in patients who tend to have less than full response to one component only. Several different polypill formulations have been developed and trials demonstrated their short term feasibility, safety and efficacy. In addition, comparison of monthly out of pocket costs between fixed combinations and additive combinations indicate the advantage of effective combination therapy.&#10;&#10;Importance of anti-diabetic and anti-lipidemic combinations should be emphasized as well: Many patients with diabetes mellitus may also be treated with dual pharmacological therapy as fixed combination: two or more drugs acting on different pathophysiological process is often necessary to reach early and sustained achievement of individualized glycemic targets. At the same time choosing the safest option to avoid hypoglycemia is of paramount importance compared with loose pill, both statin and anti-diabetic combination therapies may also have better adherence, improved satisfaction and lower drug costs.&#10;&#10;The conference is intended for experts in the fields of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, internal medicine, cardiology, nephrology, endocrinology, family medicine, primary care physicians, nurse practitioners and physicians’ assistants. All are invited to explore the current and future role of fixed combinations in the treatment of hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes.   </field>

However the therapy of infectious diseases is now under severe threat. There has been an explosion of resistance to antibiotics, whereby our entire arsenal of antibiotics is gradually losing effectiveness. This is particularly acute for Gram negative bacteria since there are few new antibiotics or strategies in the development pipeline. In this meeting we will address the major issues and potential solutions to this crisis.&#10;&#10;INNOVATION: The issues associated with gram-negative resistance, and the design of effective therapeutics, are different and more complicated than those associated with the other major division of bacteria (gram positives). Consistent with the most recent antibiotics are active against the latter class leaving academic and company researchers and physicians to wonder where the next generation of treatments will come from.&#10;&#10;For this reason, it is essential that these issues are discussed as a distinct problem that has the potential to unravel human medical successes. Here, we will bring together diverse researchers from disciplines ranging from discovery research to drug development and clinical treatment to discuss strategies for addressing this critical issue and proposing routes for innovative solutions.   </field>

These advances have been made possible through the joint contribution of very different scientific fields. Healthcare is nowadays better understood as a multidisciplinary field, with increasing number of challenges that can be better tackled by joint collaboration of researchers with different scientific backgrounds.&#10;&#10;The challenges that Healthcare is facing have not only to do with the ability of providing better services to all (treatments, preventive medicine, better diagnosis tools), with an increased focus on improved personalized treatment options, but also with the need to tackle an increased pressure felt by Healthcare systems: increased number of patients, some of them requiring expensive treatments, with a consequent increase in the workload for health institutions that most of the times have to deal with important budget restrictions.&#10;&#10;The Conference will provide a forum in which researchers coming from different scientific disciplines can discuss and share their experience regarding methodological approaches to tackle different Healthcare challenges. Contributions from operational research, industrial engineering, medicine, medical physics, management, computational biology, bioinformatics, health economics among others are welcomed.   </field>

		<field name="details">  “Trauma and Chemical Use and Addiction” will be presented on Tuesday March 31, 2015; 7:30 pm to 9:00 pm; by Dr. Tana Bridge, Ph.D., LMSW; MSW Program Director, School of Social Work, Eastern Michigan University. Current research highlights the relationship between chemical use, addition and trauma. This presentation by an award-winning trauma expert will review events involved with trauma exposure, trauma specific symptomology, the impact trauma has on the brain and on coping and subsequent substance use, and how to aid individuals struggling with trauma and addiction. This program is part of the Dawn Farm Education Series, a FREE, annual education series developed to provide accurate, helpful, hopeful, practical, current information about chemical dependency, recovery, family and related issues; and to dispel the myths, misinformation, secrecy, shame and stigma that prevent chemically dependent individuals and their families from getting help and getting well. The Education Series is designed to help people with alcoholism or other drug addictions to achieve, maintain and strengthen their recovery; assist family members and friends to understand and support recovery in people they care about as well as maintain their own health and well-being; aid professionals and students in various disciplines to work effectively with people with addictions and their families and support their recovery process; and contribute to a community culture supportive of recovery. All programs are free and open to anyone interested.  Registration is not required. 1.5 hours of free C.E. approved by NAADAC (National Association for Addiction Professionals) and MCBAP (Michigan Certification Board for Addiction Professionals) is offered for each program. A certificate to document attendance is provided on request. The Education Series is organized by Dawn Farm, a non-profit community of programs providing a continuum of chemical dependency services. For information, please contact Mark Albulov LLMSW, Dawn Farm Education Series Coordinator, at 734-485-8725 or info@dawnfarm.org, or see http://www.dawnfarm.org/programs/education-series.  </field>

On page 135 he wrote “Despite these findings, there is no doubt that as regards the generality of cancers in man, and indeed in other mammals, there is no direct evidence that viruses are concerned”.&#10;&#10;It is now estimated that about 20% of human cancers are caused by infectious agents, among them at least 7 viruses. The increasing appreciation of the role of viruses in cancer pathogenesis has not only already led to the development of two successful vaccines (against HBV and HPV) that prevent cancer, it has also directly contributed to many fundamental discoveries in cancer biology. In the last decade the understanding of virus-induced cancers has been accelerated by the extraordinary developments in genomics, epigenetics and RNA biology.&#10;&#10;To review this rapidly burgeoning field, this multidisciplinary symposium brings together experts in virology, oncology, immunology, genomics and genetics.&#10;&#10;The objective of the symposium is to explore how advances in cancer biology can inform the understanding of virus-induced cancers, and how viruses continue to reveal fundamental principles in cancer. Particular emphasis will be laid on the interaction between virus and host in persistent infections by oncogenic viruses.&#10;&#10;The meeting will cover examples of cancers where a viral cause is still under debate and the rapid development of technology for the detection of unknown viruses.   </field>

In fact, it is, now, widely recognized that psoriasis is not only confined to skin and joints as other organs and tissues may be involved. As a consequence, colleagues from other specialties are showing a growing interest on this disease. These considerations led us to promote an international meeting to discuss and to share the future directions of psoriasis. Therefore, leading dermatologists in this field will share their expertise on various aspects ranging from basic science to advances therapies. They will &quot;touch&quot; various &quot;hot topics&quot; including new insights in the genetics, pathogenic mechanisms, and management of psoriasis which are emerging beside a wide array of new discoveries.&#10;&#10;Moreover, specialists from other disciplines will be invited to approach peculiar aspects related to psoriasis from a futuristic prospective. The presence of other specialists will also allow to “catch” new developments in their disciplines.&#10;&#10;Young colleagues from all over the world will be more than welcome in presenting their recent research either in form of oral presentation or as poster.&#10;&#10;This meeting will be a fantastic and unique opportunity to increase our knowledge on psoriasis and related disorders, hosting worldwide known opinion leaders whose research has been focused on psoriasis for many years.   </field>

		<field name="details">  The causative links between genomic and genetic variations and cancer are well documented and have provided a greater understanding of tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Molecular genetic information has been used to derive new therapeutic regimens and has accelerated the development and application of &quot;personalised cancer medicine&quot;.&#10;&#10;There are also an increasing appreciation that epigenetic aberrations that are often directly caused by genetic defects resulting in loss- or gain-of-function of epigenetic-regulators also contribute significantly to cancer onset and progression. Indeed, parallel integration of our knowledge of the cancer genome and epigenome using sophisticated &quot;omics-based&quot; technologies and high throughput functional screening techniques are providing even more tangible links between genetic/genomic aberrations, epigenetic/epigenomic dysregulation and tumorigenesis.&#10;&#10;This information is being functionally validated using experimental models that accurately reflect the underlying genetic and epigenetic alterations observed in human tumor samples. Moreover, the information is being translated into clinical use through the development of genetic and epigenetic biomarkers of cancer development, evolution, heterogeneity and response to therapeutic intervention.&#10;&#10;This GRC series focuses on the advances in discovering and validating &quot;driver&quot; mutations in cancer genes, understanding the downstream consequences of these genetic changes on the epigenome and how this information is being best utilized to advance cancer detection, monitoring and therapy.  </field>

Current research continues to generate important new understanding of the molecular, cellular, and neural mechanisms underlying this control.&#10;&#10;From a disease perspective, dysregulation of these processes appears to be crucial for the development and progression of the metabolic syndrome- including obesity, glucose intolerance/diabetes and hypertension- as well as the pathogenesis associated with aging. Recent research has begun to define and characterize the neural pathways involved in these processes.&#10;&#10;This symposium will bring together breaking research advances from both the basic science and translational realms, including new knowledge of neural circuits, plasticity and signaling, as well as insights into roles for hypothalamic/brain pathways in disease development.

This currently includes not only abnormal carbohydrate metabolism and diabetes, but all other risk factors and complications related to obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypertension and pregnancy. This symposium documents the &apos;gestation&apos; of the field.&#10;&#10;Additionally, controversial topics, such as screening and diagnosis, prediction and prevention, and the use of new technologies in perinatal medicine will be discussed in detail. This will allow participants to formulate a modus operandi through evidence provided by the presenting experts.&#10;&#10;Innovations connected to perinatal research on Whole Genome Sequencing, NIPT, smallRNA&apos;s, Metabolomics and Microbiota will be discussed at length at the Symposium.&#10;&#10;The faculty is comprised of renowned professionals and practitioners from all over the world, who will present the most updated clinical and laboratory revolutions, based on evidence as well as practical experience.   </field>

The congress will appropriately consider all aspects of skin imaging, from dermatoscopy to confocal microscopy. The main topics will be amongst others early recognition and treatment of all forms of skin cancer (melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer) and in vivo imaging of inflammatory skin diseases. Addressing these issues will be a superior faculty of speakers drawn from Europe, the U.S., Canada, South America, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. I have no doubt that this meeting will be an outstanding event, both professionally and emotionally. &#10;&#10;We can also promise international delegates an exciting and uniquely Viennese social program when they visit this city. Mid April is usually a great time of the year in Vienna, the historic and modern cultural center of Austria. Social events in absolutely excellent settings will accompany the congress, while one of the world&apos;s largest sports events, the Vienna City Marathon will follow the congress. A host of tours both before and after the congress will suit both sightseer and sportsman. &#10;&#10;Harald Kittler (Congress President)&#10;Phillip Tschandl (Congress Secretary)   </field>

These metabolic disorders are a direct threat to the health and economic well-being of many nations. Unfortunately, education about diet and exercise are not sufficient to meet this emergency and new therapies are badly needed. Brown fat has emerged as one of the few genuinely new approaches to these problems. Brown fat exists in most or all adult humans and can dissipate caloric energy and improve both obesity and diabetes in experimental animals.&#10;&#10;This meeting will focus on new pathways controlling brown fat development and thermogenesis. We will delve into the types of brown fat cells, beige, classical brown and others. We will also put a special emphasis on emerging approaches, both biological and chemical, that can manipulate these cells for therapeutic purposes. It is our hope and belief that this meeting can nucleate expanded efforts in both academia and pharma to explore this promising research area.&#10;&#10;There has not been a Keystone Symposia conference dedicated to brown fat. While there has been a session here and there at the Obesity meeting, the science and the biomedical needs warrant this new and focused conference. Of course, this will also bridge the Obesity and Diabetes communities, and lead to pharma/academic collaborations.   </field>

		<field name="details">  “Intervention” will be presented on Tuesday April 21, 2015; 7:30 pm to 9:00 pm; by Jeff Jay and Debra Jay; Intervention specialists, chemical dependency therapists and trainers, and best-selling authors of “Love First: A Family’s Guide to Intervention” and other books. Intervention can be a highly effective technique for initiating the recovery process in individuals suffering from chemical dependency. Through the intervention process, people who care can learn how to use love and honesty to break through the denial that keeps a person with addiction locked in the downward spiral of his/her disease and create a moment of clarity that allows a person with addiction to accept help.  This program will describe how the “Love First” process of Intervention can help chemically dependent people find recovery. Key elements of the “Love First” intervention model developed by Jeff and Debra Jay will be discussed. This program by dynamic, highly experienced speakers will bring PRACTICAL INFORMATION, HELP and HOPE to anyone who cares about a chemically dependent person, and to anyone who wants to learn more about the intervention process. This program is part of the Dawn Farm Education Series, a FREE, annual education series developed to provide accurate, helpful, hopeful, practical, current information about chemical dependency, recovery, family and related issues; and to dispel the myths, misinformation, secrecy, shame and stigma that prevent chemically dependent individuals and their families from getting help and getting well. The Education Series is designed to help people with alcoholism or other drug addictions to achieve, maintain and strengthen their recovery; assist family members and friends to understand and support recovery in people they care about as well as maintain their own health and well-being; aid professionals and students in various disciplines to work effectively with people with addictions and their families and support their recovery process; and contribute to a community culture supportive of recovery. All programs are free and open to anyone interested.  Registration is not required. 1.5 hours of free C.E. approved by NAADAC (National Association for Addiction Professionals) and MCBAP (Michigan Certification Board for Addiction Professionals) is offered for each program. A certificate to document attendance is provided on request. The Education Series is organized by Dawn Farm, a non-profit community of programs providing a continuum of chemical dependency services. For information, please contact Mark Albulov LLMSW, Dawn Farm Education Series Coordinator, at 734-485-8725 or info@dawnfarm.org, or see http://www.dawnfarm.org/programs/education-series.  </field>

One of the key features of these insulin-resistant disorders is disturbances in lipid metabolism. Overproduction of fatty acids in the liver leads to hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL cholesterol, which are important risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis, the most common cause of death among diabetic patients.&#10;&#10;In addition, excess fatty acid production and the accumulation of hepatic cholesterol promote the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which has become one of the leading indications for liver transplantation. In addition, disturbances in bile acid metabolism may also contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, as well as gallstones. The goal of this meeting is to provide attendees with the latest advances in the understanding of mechanisms governing the metabolism of lipids and how these pathways become dysregulated in the insulin resistant state.&#10;&#10;Elucidation of mechanisms underlying lipid metabolism may reveal new therapeutic strategies to combat atherosclerosis and other complications of diabetic patients. This program will stimulate interactions that are likely to augment and accelerate this process.   </field>

The motivation is not only the recent scientific progress and new challenges of this exciting, strongly interdisciplinary field of science and engineering.&#10;&#10;Materials scientists, physicists, chemists, biologists in industrial R&amp;D as well as medical professionals are increasingly facing situations, where materials are confronted with high performance requirements and a challenging biological environment at the same time.&#10;&#10;Much of the growth in the area of biomaterials emerged in the USA and Asia over the last years but Europe is gaining ground with a fast and steady growth in this field. The German Materials Society and its panel of experts in biomaterials address these developments with the Euro BioMAT in Weimar. Euro BioMAT will present and discuss the current state of progress in development, characterization, application, testing and modelling of biomaterials in basic science and industry. In addition, this symposium will bring together experts in closely related areas, such as biomimetics, biomineralization and biopolymers.   </field>

With the problem of bone, muscle and joint diseases reaching epidemiological dimensions, treatment possibilities have digressed diversely. This development has created a need for debates and discussions on the numerous controversial issues to attain clinical conclusions.&#10;&#10;The 3rd edition of BMJD aims to continue facilitating effective debates on unresolved clinical and therapeutic dilemmas, supported by evidence-based medicine and expert opinions resulting in agreement on timely issues. The program provides an effective forum for discussing and debating such unresolved controversies by allowing ample time for speaker-audience discussions with world authorities in the fields of Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Pain, Muscles and Joint Diseases.&#10;&#10;We are proud to announce that the 3rd BMJD Congress will be held under the auspices of the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) and the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (ESCEO), making an even greater impact on the scientific community.&#10;&#10;We look forward to your participation and contribution to the 3rd World Congress on Controversies, Debates and Consensus in Bone, Muscle and Joint Diseases (BMJD), and to welcoming you to the delightful city of Montreal.   </field>

		<field name="details">  Vector borne diseases impose a disproportionate economic burden on developing countries. However, most research on the prevention of transmission of the pathogens that cause them has focused on the mammalian immune response to the pathogens, ignoring the contribution of the biting arthropod vector.&#10;&#10;The Scientific Program proposed represents breadth and depth of current hot topics in vector biology. Vector innate immunity studies have been ongoing for about a decade and this field has matured and helped our understanding of the complex interactions between pathogens and vectors. The vector microbiome represents a novel, nascent area of research with great promise for the development of novel prevention and control approaches. Vector saliva has been known to contain powerful biomolecules, but it is only recently that we have begun to understand the translational potential of these molecules. Furthermore, vectors also ingest various bioactive factors of human origin which affect the development and survival of pathogens within the vector.&#10;&#10;Purpose of the meeting:&#10;&#10;• Integrate the multiple levels of influence on disease transmission by the arthropod vector under a single meeting.&#10;• Access the extensive knowledge of innate immunity gained in Drosophila to inform vector studies, incorporate the dynamic and cutting edge research on the role of the microbiome, and explore how the biologically and immunologically active components of saliva influence transmission.&#10;• Bring together researchers from multiple scientific areas relevant to vector-borne pathogen transmission and promote the discussion and exploration of multidisciplinary approaches and collaborations to address the challenge of arthropod-transmitted diseases.&#10;• Translate immunological and microbiological insights into new approaches for combating vector-borne diseases, including manipulation of the microbiome and identification of novel, non-traditional vaccine targets (e.g., arthropod saliva proteins).  </field>

Consequently, the cellular response to hypoxia has important implications for both health and for diseases including (but not limited to) cancer, ischemia and chronic inflammation. Recently, the discovery and elucidation of specific hypoxia-inducible pathways has raised the possibility of developing new strategies for therapeutic benefit based on targeting hypoxia-sensitive pathways.&#10;&#10;The aim of this meeting is to disseminate up to date information on basic mechanisms of the cellular hypoxic response, discuss the impact of this response for health and disease and highlight the potential for developing new therapeutics based on our understanding of the pathways involved. It is anticipated that outcomes of this meeting will include the dissemination of new scientific knowledge, the discussion of new methodologies, the education of graduate students and fellows in the state-of-the-art and promoting new collaborations between clinicians, basic researchers and industrial partners.&#10;&#10;The Keystone Symposia Hypoxia meeting is widely accepted as the world’s leading conference addressing the topic and is a key date on the calendar for all researchers interested in this topic. We will bring together academic, clinical and industrial researchers to drive synergy through collaboration in developing the translational potential of targeting the HIF pathway for therapeutic benefit. This meeting will be held in conjunction with the European HypoxiaNET consortium.   </field>

Weiner, MD; and Matthew Statman, LMSW, CAADC; University of Michigan Collegiate Recovery Program Manager. Addiction is widely recognized as a chronic illness best treated with long-term monitoring and support. Primary health care settings are natural places for this care to be provided, and studies have demonstrated improved outcomes when people in recovery receive regular health care delivered by recovery-proficient providers. However, health care providers are often poorly equipped to meet the needs of this population and iatrogenic relapse is not uncommon. It&apos;s been said that the doctor&apos;s office is a dangerous place for people in recovery from addiction. It&apos;s also been said that recovering people are terrible patients. This program discusses whether these statements are fair, and why healthcare providers are essential allies for long term recovery. The program provides a basic overview of the neurobiological of addiction and its implications for health care consumers and providers, lists specific concerns related to medications, describes ways in which people in recovery from alcohol/other drug addiction can take responsibility for their health and discusses how health care providers can assist with sustaining recovery. This program is part of the Dawn Farm Education Series, a FREE, annual education series developed to provide accurate, helpful, hopeful, practical, current information about chemical dependency, recovery, family and related issues; and to dispel the myths, misinformation, secrecy, shame and stigma that prevent chemically dependent individuals and their families from getting help and getting well. The Education Series is designed to help people with alcoholism or other drug addictions to achieve, maintain and strengthen their recovery; assist family members and friends to understand and support recovery in people they care about as well as maintain their own health and well-being; aid professionals and students in various disciplines to work effectively with people with addictions and their families and support their recovery process; and contribute to a community culture supportive of recovery. All programs are free and open to anyone interested.  Registration is not required. 1.5 hours of free C.E. approved by NAADAC (National Association for Addiction Professionals) and MCBAP (Michigan Certification Board for Addiction Professionals) is offered for each program. A certificate to document attendance is provided on request. The Education Series is organized by Dawn Farm, a non-profit community of programs providing a continuum of chemical dependency services. For information, please contact Mark Albulov LLMSW, Dawn Farm Education Series Coordinator, at 734-485-8725 or info@dawnfarm.org, or see http://www.dawnfarm.org/programs/education-series.    </field>

The scientific programme includes symposia (90 minute session) and instructional lectures (60 minute session) delivered by distinguished speakers from across Europe. Free papers, e-posters, workshops, industrial symposia and technical exhibits will all feature. The Plenary Sessions (between 1.5 – 2 hours) are usually taking place during the morning on Wednesday – Friday. The congress language is English.&#10;Controversial case discussions (90 minutes) and pro and con debates invite you actively to contribute and share your knowledge with colleagues from all around Europe. Participants of the ExMEx sessions (between 2-4 hours) can gain specialised expertise and share information with different opinion leaders on a specific topic in a group limited to 100 colleagues (a separate registration is necessary).&#10;For the scientific programme we have successively increased collaboration with our specialty society partners. These sessions are embedded into the overall programme called: Guest Sessions. Along with the scientific exhibition, our congresses cover the whole range of contemporary orthopaedics and traumatology issues in Europe. At each event we share scientific findings, experience and participants gain a greater awareness of future trends.   </field>

		<field name="details">  Neurotrophic factors play essential roles in the developing and mature nervous system. While Nerve growth factor (NGF) was the first neurotrophic factor when it was identified more than 50 years ago, a large set of related and unrelated extracellular proteins are now known to exert neurotrophic effects in the developing and mature nervous system. The roles of neurotrophic factors include regulation of cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, migration, axon and dendrite growth, synaptic plasticity and the interactions of neuronal and glial cells. As a result, neurotrophic factors affect complex behaviors including feeding, anxiety, depression and learning, and aberrations in the activities of neurotrophic factors have been implicated in multiple neurologic and psychiatric disorders.&#10;&#10;The Neurotrophic Factors Gordon Conference provides a great opportunity to learn of recent advances in this broad field, and enhances collaborations among scientists and students. The meeting will feature work on diverse neurotrophic factors and their roles in neurogenesis, neuronal migration, survival, plasticity, behavior and diseases, including disorders of neural development such as autism and epilepsy and degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease and peripheral neuropathies. Emphasis will be placed on the most recent developments.   </field>

As one of the biggest congresses on imaging children worldwide it has the reputation of presenting the most modern advances in paediatric radiology using innovative techniques, superbly combined with advanced and basic education options, not only for specialists, but for all who have to deal with imaging and treating children.&#10;Fostering communication and cooperation with our partner disciplines, paediatrics and paediatric surgery (e.g. paediatric urologists, paediatric cardiologists), is another goal of this congress. Additionally, the implications of all the modern options and new approaches in modern imaging in neonates, infants and children will be discussed. &#10;A particular interest of this congress is the involvement of young radiologists, particularly from eastern European countries, where neither basic education nor advanced training are widely or easily accessible. Mini symposia and lunch workshops will help broaden understanding and give time for in-depth discussion in smaller groups. About 500 participants are expected from all over the world, who will engage in providing state-of-the-art imaging services for future generations.   </field>

This meeting will explore the biology of exercise from a whole-body perspective as to how the body and brain adapt its metabolism during exercise to the cellular level, looking at fuel use and how exercise induces browning of white fat. We will also explore other beneficial effects of exercise, including protection against neurodegeneration and whether it might be possible to generate exercise in a pill. </field>

MicroRNAs act to promote or repress cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis during development, all processes that go awry in cancer. Thus, microRNAs have the ability to behave like oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Their small size and molecular properties make microRNAs amenable as targets and therapeutics in cancer treatment.&#10;&#10;MicroRNAs thus present a paradigm shift in thinking about gene regulation during development and disease and provide the oncologist with a potentially powerful new battery of agents to diagnose and treat cancer. However, while hundreds of human microRNAs and noncoding RNAs are known, relatively little is known about their roles and targets, and there is still a limited literature on using these molecules in the clinic.&#10;&#10;The specific aims of this meeting serve to address these deficiencies and are as follows:&#10;&#10;1) Focus on the exciting biology of microRNAs and noncoding RNAs in controlling developmental and cancer processes like cell proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle, apoptosis and metastasis. This meeting will highlight the best current research into the role that miRNAs play in these fundamental processes and provide the basic understanding that will drive the invention of powerful clinical tools;&#10;2) Focus on the latest efforts to harness the power of these RNAs as agents in the fight against cancer. Discussions will range from use of miRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic markers in cancer, to SNPs providing risk factors for cancer, to the delivery and effectiveness of small RNA therapeutics in clinically relevant settings;&#10;3) Attract the best researchers working in small RNAs and cancer to one place for critical discussions that will advance the field and accelerate the benchside to bedside use of this technology;&#10;4) Provide a stimulating environment where students, postdocs and junior investigators can present and discuss their research with the best minds in the field.   </field>

Upon completion, participants should be able to diagnose, treat and perhaps prevent many of the infections commonly seen.  Topics include some of the newer antibiotics and antivirals used in the US in 2014, as well as specific pathogens commonly seen such in clinical practice.  The two case reports are taken from classic presentations of illnesses seen in an office practice with discussion of the literature and treatment.   With more of our families traveling we will also discuss travel advice including both antibiotics and vaccines indicated for the different regions of the world. Lastly we will discuss MRSA, a pathogen hitting our communities and children in ever increasing numbers.  There will be time for questions related to these topics as well as open discussion regarding pathogens of interest to the attendees. This seminar will be relevant to family practitioners, pediatricians, infectious disease specialists, as well as other health professionals who manage pediatric patients.   </field>

		<field name="details">   Neurodegenerative diseases represent a major challenge for today’s society in terms of the large and rapidly increasing number of the population that are afflicted and the general lack of effective treatments. The emphasis of this symposium will be on the genetic, cellular and molecular basis of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Prion disease. The meeting will cover the major mechanisms linked to neurodegeneration and highlight the similarities and differences between the diseases. A strong emphasis will be placed on the development of targeted drug therapies and potential treatment options.&#10;&#10;This meeting aims to bring together basic and clinical research scientists working on different forms of neurodegeneration with their counterparts from the biotechnology and pharma industry to apply recent insights gained in the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases and the development of drug therapies. This symposium will bridge the gap between basic research and medical research in an area that urgentlyrequires therapeutic progress, and emphasise the public health challenges in a public forum with senior public heath officials, research scientists, industry representatives and patient advocates.   </field>

		<field name="details">  “How to Support Recovery and Not Support Addiction” will be presented on Tuesday June 16, 2015; 7:30 pm to 9:00 pm; by Dr. Charles F. Gehrke, MD, FACP, FASAM.  The course of an individual’s alcohol/other drug addiction may often be influenced by family members, friends, employers and others. The disease of addiction is often poorly understood, and the behaviors of a person with addiction are often bewildering to family and friends. Well-intentioned but poorly-informed individuals may inadvertently act in ways that can enable addiction to progress.  When all else has failed - what does work when confronted with a loved one’s addiction? What does not work? What can others do to help? What does not help? What role does an individual play in supporting another person’s recovery process? These and other questions will be addressed in order to assist participants to find effective methods to successfully support another person’s recovery, avoid enabling another person’s addiction, and maintain their own health and well-being. This program is part of the Dawn Farm Education Series, a FREE, annual education series developed to provide accurate, helpful, hopeful, practical, current information about chemical dependency, recovery, family and related issues; and to dispel the myths, misinformation, secrecy, shame and stigma that prevent chemically dependent individuals and their families from getting help and getting well. The Education Series is designed to help people with alcoholism or other drug addictions to achieve, maintain and strengthen their recovery; assist family members and friends to understand and support recovery in people they care about as well as maintain their own health and well-being; aid professionals and students in various disciplines to work effectively with people with addictions and their families and support their recovery process; and contribute to a community culture supportive of recovery. All programs are free and open to anyone interested.  Registration is not required. 1.5 hours of free C.E. approved by NAADAC (National Association for Addiction Professionals) and MCBAP (Michigan Certification Board for Addiction Professionals) is offered for each program. A certificate to document attendance is provided on request. The Education Series is organized by Dawn Farm, a non-profit community of programs providing a continuum of chemical dependency services.

		<field name="details">  In comparison to studies on infections of the nervous system in western societies, studies on diseases of such nature in the developing world have been neglected. This is paradoxical as neurotropic pathogens are frequent in the developing world and contribute significantly to human suffering and disease burden. Moreover living with neurological handicap and/or cognitive dysfunction will have a significant impact on socio-economic development. As the central nervous system is usually not the primary target site of infection, a window of opportunity exists to interfere with pathogen spreading.&#10;&#10;The Gordon Research Conference on &quot;Infections of the nervous system&quot; will advance knowledge in the field and promote exchanges between medical research centers in resource-rich and -poor regions. The format of GRC (community-based, small audience, focus on unpublished material) is ideal to create a multidisciplinary dialogue that will involve both clinicians and scientists studying disease mechanisms and host genetics, the molecular make-up of neurotropic infectious agents, and the innate and adaptive immune response to neurotropic pathogens. In addition, groups working on developing new technologies for diagnosis and prognosis will be included.&#10;&#10;This new series will bring together renowned clinicians and scientists, who investigate clinical disease manifestations and the molecular mechanisms underlying worldwide infections of the nervous system in humans. This will foster collaborations to accelerate/expand investigations and use new technologies allowing fast development of diagnostic/prognostic tools and pioneering drug discoveries.  </field>

		<field name="details">  This conference, which initially focused on toxigenic fungi and mycotoxins, was expanded in 1987 to include algae and phycotoxins. Combining the two fields has been beneficial because, while fungi and algae are very different microorganisms, they and their toxins nonetheless present common scientific challenges. The conference serves as a forum for scientists sharing the goal of reducing health risks and economic losses caused by these toxins in foods, feeds and the environment, for sharing the latest data, for developing novel approaches to ongoing problems, and for identifying new toxin-related research needs. The conference has a history of generous support from the USDA, FDA, NIEHS, NOAA, other government entities and corporations.&#10;&#10;Myco- and phycotoxin research requires a multidisciplinary approach incorporating chemistry, microbiology, ecology, genetics, agronomy, pharmacology, toxicology, molecular biology, epidemiology and other fields. A major strength of the Mycotoxin and Phycotoxin Conference is the high level of scientific expertise from these fields represented at the meetings. Among the conference topics are: identification and characterization of toxigenic microorganisms and their toxins, biosynthetic pathways, genetic-biomolecular controls of biosynthesis, and environmental triggers for toxin production. Additional topics include development of rapid, sensitive and cost effective analytical methods, novel biomarkers and improved exposure assessments for vulnerable animal and human populations, toxicology and mechanisms of action, risk assessment, and reducing exposures through the development of effective intervention strategies.&#10;&#10;The introduction of students and young scientists to the mycotoxin and phycotoxin research communities is another important aspect of the conference. By providing a venue for them to discuss their research with experts and to build professional relationships, the conference contributes to the continuity of myco- and phycotoxin research. In summary, through a unique combination of toxins, scientific disciplines, experts and young scientists, the Mycotoxin and Phycotoxin GRC serves as a catalyst for research having the ultimate goal of maintaining a safe food supply and environment.  </field>

		<field name="details">  About 50-200 billion of our cells die daily by apoptosis or programmed cell death in the human body. The mechanisms of apoptosis have been extensively studied, but those of the elimination of apoptotic cells are much less understood. Apoptotic cells are rapidly engulfed and digested by their neighbors or by professional phagocytes in a process known as phagocytosis, clearance or efferocytosis. During development this process plays a key role in tissue morphogenesis and renewal. It also allows for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis in adults and promotes the resolution of inflammation. Failure to clear apoptotic cells can result in developmental defects, chronic inflammatory disorders, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. For example, it has been associated with Lupus, a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease, and with retinal degeneration. Dying cells can be cleared before completion of their programmed death, and failure in this process may result in cancer.&#10;&#10;A thorough understanding of efferocytosis is essential to design new therapies to prevent or treat chronic inflammation, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Some of the molecular mechanisms of apoptotic cell clearance are shared with those of pathogen clearance, and thus studying efferocytosis will also lead to new therapies to fight infections. This is critical since pathogens are becoming resistant to current treatments.&#10;&#10;At this Gordon Research Conference on Apoptotic Cell Recognition &amp; Clearance, we will discuss the latest advances made in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of apoptotic cell recognition and clearance in all model organisms, from worm, fly, fish and mouse, to mammalian (including human) cells in the context of both healthy and disease states.  </field>

		<field name="details">  “Relapse Prevention” will be presented on Tuesday June 23, 2015; 7:30 pm to 9:00 pm; by Erik Anderson LLMSW; Dawn Farm Outpatient Therapist. Addiction has been identified as a illness that requires  long-term management. Relapse is a process that begins before alcohol/other drug use is resumed and is usually preceded by a pattern of progressive warning signs. Understanding the relapse process assists recovering people to develop an effective plan to identify and prevent  relapse. This program will discuss the dynamics of relapse, signs that may forewarn of relapse, how to develop a relapse prevention plan and strategies to handle both everyday and high-risk situations. This program is part of the Dawn Farm Education Series, a FREE, annual education series developed to provide accurate, helpful, hopeful, practical, current information about chemical dependency, recovery, family and related issues; and to dispel the myths, misinformation, secrecy, shame and stigma that prevent chemically dependent individuals and their families from getting help and getting well. The Education Series is designed to help people with alcoholism or other drug addictions to achieve, maintain and strengthen their recovery; assist family members and friends to understand and support recovery in people they care about as well as maintain their own health and well-being; aid professionals and students in various disciplines to work effectively with people with addictions and their families and support their recovery process; and contribute to a community culture supportive of recovery. All programs are free and open to anyone interested.  Registration is not required. 1.5 hours of free C.E. approved by NAADAC (National Association for Addiction Professionals) and MCBAP (Michigan Certification Board for Addiction Professionals) is offered for each program. A certificate to document attendance is provided on request. The Education Series is organized by Dawn Farm, a non-profit community of programs providing a continuum of chemical dependency services. For information, please contact Mark Albulov LLMSW, Dawn Farm Education Series Coordinator, at 734-485-8725 or info@dawnfarm.org, or see http://www.dawnfarm.org/programs/education-series.  </field>

		<field name="details">  The GRC on Epithelial Differentiation and Keratinization started in 1979, as a pioneering effort of dermatologists and cell biologists with a keen interest in research on skin, who saw the unique advantages of keratinocytes to probe the basis of epithelial tissue homeostasis.&#10;&#10;Further, it offered the opportunity to study growth/differentiation control, as well as the translation of basic studies to human disease. Over the years the conference has evolved very significantly, with an increased focus on molecular, cellular and developmental biology and has become the main international meeting for presentation and discussions of cutting-edge basic research on epithelial biology on a broad range of topics.&#10;&#10;The conference is held once every two years and attracts intense interest and is always heavily oversubscribed.&#10;  </field>

		<field name="details">  Organometallic Chemistry straddles the boundary between two of the major areas of the chemical sciences: inorganic and organic chemistry. Because of its ties to both of these traditional areas of chemistry, new developments in Organometallic Chemistry impact both inorganic and organic chemistry and applications of organometallic chemistry often have effects that reach far beyond these boundaries. The Organometallic Chemistry Gordon Research Conference will highlight cutting edge developments in basic science and applications including synthesis, reactivity, catalysis, and bonding theory.&#10;&#10;Solutions to some of the major issues that face modern society such as the production of alternative fuels, chemistry to mitigate climate change and the development of new drugs will likely have components that are a direct result of organometallic chemistry. With its collegial atmosphere, and plenty of opportunity for discussion during the program, at poster sessions and social gatherings, this conference provides a fertile setting for discussion of these large issues amongst researchers from different fields. Participants will include a diverse group of scientists, doing research at the cutting edge of their fields from the US and abroad, ranging from senior investigators to junior scientists and graduate students.  </field>

		<field name="details">  Neural crest cells and cranial sensory placodes are of central importance to the development and evolution of vertebrates, and are also of high clinical significance. This conference is designed to facilitate shared insights among attendees and fuel further advances in our understanding of the mechanisms governing the formation, behavior and differentiation of these two cell populations, as well as to catalyze the application of this knowledge to the field of regenerative medicine. The central goals of the conference are to accelerate the exchange of information across different model systems, to promote technological innovations in the field, and to further a genome and proteome scale understanding of the mechanisms that govern the development of neural crest cells and cranial sensory placodes.&#10;&#10;Both neural crest cells and cranial placode cells make extensive contributions to embryonic structures, and defects in their development underlie a broad range of congenital disorders. Neural crest cells display stem cell attributes, and neural crest-derived cells persist as stem cells into adulthood; studies of these cells provide broad insights into stem cell biology. Moreover, neural crest cells undergo migratory and invasive behavior driven by core EMT regulatory factors, and understanding how their behavior is regulated provides insights into the related invasive behavior of metastatic tumor cells. Cranial placode cells play important roles in the development of cranial sensory structures; mutations in genes that regulate their development lead to human syndromes with severe sensory deficits and dysregulated cell cycle control in numerous cancers. The conference will bring together a diverse group of scientists in a collegial atmosphere that fosters substantive discussions and promotes collaborative interactions between basic and clinical scientists in this important area of biomedical research.  </field>

		<field name="details">  The field of pancreatic disease is wide and it combines disparate research communities of basic scientists, endocrinologists, oncologists and surgeons specializing in the cell biology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diabetes, cancer and pancreatitis. Pancreatic neoplasms are among the most malignant and untreatable forms of cancer. The inability of pancreatic beta cells to supply insulin in amounts adequate to meet metabolic needs is the ultimate cause of all forms of diabetes. The epidemic increase of this disease represents a major threat to human health and society. Diabetes often precedes pancreatic cancer and is thus regarded as a potential risk factor for malignancy.&#10;&#10;Chronic pancreatitis, in turn, can result in the disruption of pancreatic islets and diabetes. Lineage-tracing studies in mice are unraveling the transcriptional program and signaling pathways presiding pancreatic organogenesis and the specification of its exocrine and endocrine components. This information is being exploited to devise protocols for the differentiation of embryonic stem/induced-pluripotent stem cells into pancreatic beta cells for the regenerative therapy of diabetes. Moreover, pancreatic ductal and acinar cells are being considered as potential sources for regeneration/transdifferentiation of pancreatic beta cells.&#10;&#10;Hence, the broad scope of this conference is to support the development of a multidisciplinary research community addressing medical, biological, chemical and pharmacological topics related to the diversity and complexity of pancreatic diseases. This long-term objective will be achieved through a series of conferences, in which the emphasis of the various topics will vary overtime depending on the most recent and promising discoveries on pancreatic biology and diseases. Progress will be further fostered through the selected invitation of highly ranked investigators from other scientific areas. Through the contribution of leading experts, we expect to identify novel concepts for the pharmacological and cell-based treatment of pancreatic diseases. To set the stage for this ambitious program, the kick-off conference of this series will deliberately cover the wide-spectrum of pancreatic diseases, with emphasis on regenerative medicine.&#10;&#10;Future topics of special interests will include, but not be restricted to: a) novel insight into the cell biology and physiology of pancreatic cells; b) signaling pathways connecting pancreatic cells to other gastrointestinal organs and the nervous system; c) the contribute of environmental agents (e.g. nutrients, pathogens and toxic agents) towards the development of pancreatic diseases; d) genetic and epigenetic susceptibility to pancreatic disorders; e) biomarkers for the prevention, early diagnosis, and personalized treatment of pancreatic diseases; f) inflammation and pancreatic diseases and autoimmune pancreatitis. &#10;  </field>

		<field name="details">  Elastin, Elastic Fibers and Microfibrils conference is now recognized as the major international meeting for investigators with an interest in the biochemistry, cellular and molecular biology, and pathology of elastin. Over the years to follow, the breadth of the field has grown even more due to identification and study of numerous additional molecules that influence the regulation, assembly and function of elastic fibers, such as the fibulins, latent TGF-beta binding proteins, emilins, proteoglycans and lysyl oxidases.&#10;&#10;The Conference is unique in the depth of its coverage of elastin biology, spanning from detailed, high-resolution structural studies of elastin and fibrillin, to in vitro assembly assays, to functional in vivo research with transgenic and knockout animals, to human disease, and finally to biomaterials and therapies. The unusual biology of elastic fibers has brought together basic scientists with diverse areas of expertise, including physical chemistry, engineering, cell and molecular biology, developmental biology, biochemistry and biotechnology. Furthermore, because of the involvement of elastin and elastic fiber associated proteins in numerous pathological processes, past Gordon Conferences have attracted investigators with a wide spectrum of clinical interests, including emphysema, COPD, pulmonary and vascular hypertension, atherosclerosis, aneurysms, genetic diseases, and cutaneous and eye diseases.&#10;&#10;Over the years, the content and focus of the Elastin and Elastic Fibers GRC has been constantly evolving, reflecting changing trends and ideas. Attendees of previous conferences enthusiastically agree that this meeting provides the most important forum for communication and collaboration among investigators in this field. As such, this conference has had, and will continue to have, a major role in stimulating interest and influencing the direction of research in this field.  </field>

Diseases of the immune system and the musculoskeletal diseases frequently are recognized in young and middle aged individuals, however the epidemiology is changing and it is common to see elderly individuals with autoimmune diseases including vasculitis and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, musculoskeletal diseases such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, while they are major diseases of the elderly can often be the result of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.&#10;&#10;This conference will focus on the cells that control the immune system, their function in health, disease and aging, and the role of inflammation on musculoskeletal diseases of aging. At the end of this conference the participants will understand immune cell function in health and disease, and aging. The format of this conference will include plenary sessions with related abstracts presented by participants, daily poster sessions, and free time to network, discuss and reflect on the ideas presented at the conference.  </field>

Haley Veterans’ Hospital. His research focuses on clinical STD/HIV therapeutics, investigational anti-infectives, and investigational vaccines. He is a Principal Investigator with the Shingles Prevention Study (VA Cooperative Study CSP#403) herpes zoster vaccine, the largest study ever to investigate this disease and the largest VA vaccine study ever performed (38,546 subjects overall enrolled). This data assisted Merck in receiving FDA approval for the vaccine (Zostavax) in 2006. He is PI with the SPS CSP#403c Long-Term Persistence Substudy, investigating the 10-year overall durability of patients originally vaccinated in the original VA CSP#403 trial. His research is supported by grants from the VA and pharmaceutical company contracts.&#10;&#10;He is the founding and current Medical Director of the Southeast Region STD/HIV Prevention Training Center, one of the CDC National Network of STD/HIV Prevention Training Centers. The Southeast Region STD/HIV Prevention Training Center (SEPTC - formerly the Florida STD/HIV PTC) is a joint project of the Florida Department of Health Bureau of STD Prevention and Control (BSTDPC), USF College of Medicine, Division of Infectious Disease and International Medicine, and the CDC. The Center was created in 1988 in response to Florida&apos;s significant STD morbidity with initial CDC funding until 1992. The Center became a Florida state-funded BSTDPC collaboration effort in 1992 and at that time, was the only state-supported STD/HIV PTC in the nation. In May 2000, the Center was successful competed for CDC grant funding to become part of the CDC National Network of STD/HIV Prevention Training Centers, and was refunded again by the CDC after competitive grant submission in April 2006 (R30 Cooperative Agreement).  </field>

		<field name="details">  The ISIRV International Meeting on Respiratory Pathogens is the first of a continual series of biennial ISIRV meetings on this topic, and aims to be the premier global meeting on respiratory viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens. Respiratory pathogens result in substantial burden of disease and costs to communities globally. They range from emerging and re-emerging diseases as avian influenza viruses, MERS-CoV, pertussis, tuberculosis, and antimicrobial resistant pathogens; to endemic diseases that result in high morbidity and severe cases with mortality.&#10;&#10;This meeting will focus on addressing these gaps through the sharing of recent advances in epidemiology, immunology, diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics and clinical management. It will bring together clinicians, public health professionals, scientists, and policy makers to learn about respiratory pathogens, and discuss what are the next steps in reducing the burden of these diseases through research and policy initiatives. A full day of parallel sessions will be devoted to providing updates for policy makers to increase their understanding on respiratory diseases and to allow for better research-policy interactions that will accelerate transnational research. </field>

It was established to improve the quality of life of the world’s older people by sharing research results on health, welfare, and rights, functioning as a worldwide network to achieve the goal.&#10;It was originally known as the International Association of Gerontological Societies, and then it was later changed to the International Association of Gerontology (IAG). In 2004, the IAG’s Council of Directors decided to include geriatrics in the name, hence the change to IAGG for the 18th World Congress in 2005.  </field>

It is now clear that congenital heart defects result from disorders in developmental mechanisms of differentiation and morphogenesis and that these disorders are often the consequence of genetic variation.&#10;&#10;Moreover, there is increasing evidence that these same developmental mechanisms and genetic variations contribute to heart disease throughout life, and this understanding could be leveraged for regenerative therapies.&#10;&#10;This meeting will highlight new concepts in cardiovascular development, regeneration, and repair and will emphasize common molecular mechanisms with therapeutic potential for cardiovascular regeneration. Sessions on the regulatory mechanisms of cardiac development, lineage specification, stem cell differentiation, and proliferation will integrate current insights into the molecular mechanisms connecting patterning, morphogenesis, homeostasis, and disease. Emerging technologies for genome editing and imaging will be discussed with the aim of facilitating new research directions and translational approaches.&#10;&#10;Overall, the goal of this meeting is to bring together researchers with expertise in cardiac development, molecular biology, stem cell biology, genetics, and epigenetics to facilitate our understanding of heart development and homeostasis and to explore scientific directions and therapeutic approaches for the treatment of heart disease in children and adults. </field>

In particular, DC meetings are devoting considerable attention to adaptive immune responses while macrophage meetings focus on innate immunity.&#10;&#10;Yet, it is clear that both cell types share many common properties and eventually contribute to a protective immunity. We therefore propose a meeting that aims to reunite the two communities of scientists.&#10;&#10;This meeting will be equally divided into basic biology and sessions dedicated to the importance of these cells in pathology including allergy, autoimmunity, cancer and infectious disease. </field>

It now includes over 200 annual individual members from over 20 countries.&#10;&#10;ISUH organizes a bi-annual event International Conference on Urban Health, hosted by a selected member institution. International Conference on Urban Health provides an international forum for information-exchange among urban health stakeholders. The first ICUH was held in Toronto, Canada in 2002 and focused on inner-city health. From there, the conference moved to New York 2003 &amp; 2010, Boston 2004, Amsterdam 2006, Baltimore 2007, Brazil 2011, Vancouver 2008, and Nairobi 2009. It is now the explicit aim of ISUH to host the conference in a different global city every other year in order to broaden the reach of the Urban Health Society and the impact of its efforts.  And thus the ISUH has selected Dhaka Bangladesh to host the 12th International Conference on Urban Health in 2015. The theme for the 12th International Conference on Urban Health is Urban Health for Sustainable Future: Post 2015 Agenda.&#10;</field>

Prevention at the source is the overall congress theme, as this is key in controlling (infectious) diseases that have a growing impact on humans, animals and their ecosystems.&#10;&#10;The 3rd International One Health Congress focuses on multidisciplinary collaboration involving human, veterinary and eco-health disciplines, other life sciences, social sciences, and informatics. The One Health approach is needed to ensure an improved and sustainable human and animal health and is key to improve monitoring, analysis and prevention of novel global threats posed by re-emerging(infectious) diseases and food safety hazards.&#10;&#10;The scientific focus of the 3rd International One Health Congress will be on how science can help in preventing emerging and re-emerging (infectious) diseases. Simultaneously, a Science Policy Interface (SPI) track will be organized to bring established key scientists working in the respective One Health areas together with policymakers, businessmen, funders, governors and International One Health organizations. The aim of this track is to discuss and integrate One Health advancements into the decision making process. </field>

Leaders with responsibility for both employees and results face globalized competition, needs for reduction of costs, new technology, mergers and downsizing as some examples of many everyday challenges. The question work and organisational psychology need to provide new and good answers to is therefor; How can one manage respectfully, contribute to the wider good of society and at the same time create, adapt and maintain an effective and sustainable organization?&#10;The EAWOP 2015 Congress will address this complex and yet very basic question in its full breadth. In this we aim to show both the importance and usefulness of work and organizational psychology in this respect and at the same time contribute to the expansion of our common and highly valuable knowledge base. In the fine spirit of EAWOP&apos;s mission the interaction between and contribution from both academia and professionals in the field will be central to the conference.

Example indications include a potential anomaly in the setting of maternal obesity, oligohydramnios, or advanced gestational age. &#10;An abnormality is identifed on ultrasonography and the treating physician desires MR-specific information in order to make decisions about care. An example might include the calculation of MR-derived fetal lung volumes in cases of congenital diaphragmatic hernia.&#10;A fetus is significantly at risk for abnormality that will affect prognosis even if no finding is discovered with ultrasound, eg neurologic ischemia after laser ablation of placental anastomoses in Twin-Twin Transfusion Syndrome.&#10;Limitations to fetal MRI include &#10;&#10;Gestational age &lt; 17 weeks&#10;Maternal weight exceeding table recommendations (per manufacturer)&#10;Claustrophobia. Many women who are concerned about claustrophobia can be coaxed through an examination with patience, the consolation of a family member of friend holding their hand in the MR unit, supplemental oxygen, repositioning into decubitus position, and/or the use of diversions including eye coverings/DVD viewers. &#10;Assessment of many (but not all) fetal skeletal abnormalities&#10;REQUIREMENTS AND NEAR-REQUIREMENTS&#10;gestational age: The ACR recommends that fetal MR be deferred until after 20 weeks. This is in part because the fetus is so small at earlier gestational ages that MR is unlikely to add much additional information to ultrasound, but it is also because the effects of energy deposition on developing structures are not completely understood. There is concern for the developing auditory apparatus in particular.&#10;MR environment: A 1.5 T system is standard. Some centers are experimenting with 3T units, but one would have to be reassured that energy deposition translated as heating (SAR) remains within recommended levels. Coil selection depends on the size of the patient: the higher resolutions achieved with surface coils (such as a cardiac coil) are preferred, but larger multichannel torso coils are used successfully, and sometimes no surface coil can be used because there is no room between the patient and the magnet bore. An abdominal circumference greater than 130 cm has been suggested as an indication for a larger surface coil (ref: Prayer). Surface coils of course can be repositioned during the exam to better cover the fetal part being imaged.  The patient is best imaged supine, or in left lateral decubitus postion to avoid compression of the inferior vena cava.&#10;Ultrasound : Some centers always perform a complete fetal ultrasound prior to MRI. The advantages are that a demise is detected before MR is inititated; fetal lie is known so that coil position is optimized if only limited sequences can be obtained; the anatomic questions are well understood so that the MR can be appropriately protocoled to target the answers. For some centers, ultrasound first is not possible, and in this situation, it will be necessary to perform an ultrasound following the MR, or at least to have a report from recent ultrasonography for correlation of biometric measurements and anatomy.&#10;RISKS AND BENEFITS&#10;The principal theoretical risk of fetal MR relates to excess tissue heating, which has been associated with growth retardation and congenital malformations in various animal models. Similar malformations have been observed in children born to women who experienced significant hyperthermia in the first trimester of pregnancy. Numerous reports in the biological physics literature have addressed the theoretical risks of tissue heating related to exposure to the radio-frequency electromagnetic fields that are generated by MR. Guidelines for the general public do exist for maximum exposure limits for the rate at which energy is absorbed by the body when exposed to RF electromagnetic fields (as measured by the Specific Absorption Rate – SAR). Safe limits have also been suggested for maternal and fetal body temperature. Biological physicists studying the effects of MR have noted in experimental models that meeting exposure limits for the pregnant woman may not protect the fetus from overexposure, and that the safety of the fetus may be overestimated in numerous models. These reports, which rely heavily on mathematical and computational modeling for MR effects, emphasize that a paucity of data are available regarding exposure of the fetus to MR generated radio-frequency electromagnetic fields, and that further work is required.&#10;</field>

Together we have formed an enthusiastic local team that have worked and will continue to work hard to develop an interesting and stimulating conference program for you under the heading: “Respectful and effective leadership - managing people and organizations in turbulent times”.&#10;We believe this is an important and timely topic for our conference in 2015 as Europe and the world face and have faced turbulent times in many respects, posing serious challenges to employees, teams, organizations, nations and leaders. Leaders with responsibility for both employees and results face globalized competition, needs for reduction of costs, new technology, mergers and downsizing as some examples of many everyday challenges. The question work and organisational psychology need to provide new and good answers to is therefor; How can one manage respectfully, contribute to the wider good of society and at the same time create, adapt and maintain an effective and sustainable organization?&#10;The EAWOP 2015 Congress will address this complex and yet very basic question in its full breadth. In this we aim to show both the importance and usefulness of work and organizational psychology in this respect and at the same time contribute to the expansion of our common and highly valuable knowledge base. In the fine spirit of EAWOP&apos;s mission the interaction between and contribution from both academia and professionals in the field will be central to the conference. Therefore, please join us in Oslo to contribute your knowledge, your questions, your answers and your suggestions to this important question and to learn from the work and thoughts of esteemed and hard-working colleagues from all around the world.&#10;The conference will be held in city centre of Oslo, the capital of Norway, a vibrant modern city but also the oldest of the Scandinavian capitals with a history going back 1000 years. You will discover that Oslo have all the coziness of a small town, with great opportunities for social interaction, placed in the most fantastic natural surroundings and with great possibilities for cultural experiences.&#10;</field>

Low level replenishment of the reservoir via limited cycles of replication, may also contribute to persistence, at least in some patients. Curing HIV infection will only occur if these barriers are reversed, or if host capacity to control HIV indefinitely is improved.&#10;&#10;A number of promising interventions which might reverse latent infection have been identified, and proof that such drugs affect HIV transcription in vivo provided in pilot clinical trials. The observation that few patients treated during primary infection control durably replication-competent HIV after interrupting therapy suggests host responses might be manipulated, leading to a functional cure. The path forward will require a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of viral latency which could lead to the identification of new drugs, and a better knowledge of the plasticity and dynamics of the main HIV cell reservoirs: CD4 T cells and macrophages.&#10;&#10;The role of the tissue microenvironment has to be underlined with the major help of non-human primate models. At the 2015 Keystone Symposia meeting on Mechanisms of HIV Persistence: Implications for a Cure, experts from both within and outside the HIV field will present findings from recent advances on immune mechanisms and therapeutic strategies which could lead to HIV cure.&#10;&#10;</field>

Active efflux is a mechanism responsible for moving toxic substances and antibiotics out of the cell; this is considered to be a vital part of xenobiotic metabolism. Multidrug efflux systems display the ability to transport a variety of structurally unrelated substrates from a cell and consequently are capable of conferring resistance to a diverse range of chemotherapeutic agents. The importance of efflux is now broadly recognized in clinical settings as it not only contributes to drug resistance in bacterial and mammalian cells, including cancer, but is also important in drug development efforts as it is a defining factor in drug distribution and elimination in tissues and organs. In addition to the efflux mechanisms, systems controlling the influx of solutes also contribute to multi-drug resistance and xenobiotic metabolism. New roles of influx and efflux in adaptation to various environments and signaling continue to emerge.&#10;&#10;Participants of the highly appreciated and productive past meetings on multi-drug efflux systems have made unprecedented progress in the understanding of fundamental mechanisms, diversity and functions of multi-drug efflux systems. The 6th meeting will focus on translating this fundamental knowledge into development of novel therapeutic, diagnostic and bioengineering tools. This conference will address both the efflux and influx systems, as the balance of these two counter flows defines and regulates substrate/drug accumulation in all cells and tissues. The conference will start with two keynote lectures provided by internationally recognized leaders in the field of membrane transporters. Following the keynote lectures, scientific sessions will be held to address the roles and biochemical mechanisms of drug transporters in normal physiology and pathology, in drug discovery and development as well as the emerging roles of drug transporters in stems cells, bioengineering and biofuel production.&#10;&#10;Scientific sessions:&#10;&#10;- Multi-drug efflux pumps in health and disease&#10;- Functional interactions between influx and efflux in health and clinical conditions&#10;- Role of multi-drug efflux in drug discovery and development&#10;- Structure and molecular dynamics of membrane transporters&#10;- Structure-function relationships in multi-drug efflux pumps from microbes and humans&#10;- Protein expression, folding, and membrane trafficking of membrane transporters&#10;- Multi-drug efflux pumps in the environment, bioengineering and biofuel production&#10;- Transport proteins in stem cells and clinical implications&#10;</field>

With large-scale collaborative projects underway and sequencing data placed in the public domain, there is a rich source of information for researchers and companies looking for opportunities in this exciting field. With increasing signs that our microbiome may be the key not only for curative but preventative medicine, efforts are focusing on increasing both investment opportunities, clinical trials and innovative research in this area. With an increasing focus on healthy living and a therapeutics market that is expected to grow to $1.2 trillion by 2016, microbial research can be developed in order to provide preventative treatments, cures, therapies and supplements for a worldwide audience in demand.&#10;&#10;Attracting over 225 attendees, the forum will build upon the success of last year’s European meeting as well as our popular US and Asian events to explore the interface between our evolving cultures, technologies and our microbiome through a series of interactive presentations with leading academics and industry experts, panel discussions and an exhibition area allowing solution providers to showcase their products and services. The latest academic and industry research will explore the human microbiome across the following areas:&#10;&#10;    Characterising the human microbiome&#10;    Venture capital, collaborations and investment&#10;    The human microbiome’s effect on health and disease&#10;    New research into different microbial systems – both inside and outside the GI tract&#10;    Probiotics, prebiotics, diet and the microbiome&#10;    Antibiotic resistance&#10;    Skin and dermatology research&#10;</field>

This is where the potential of a drug is evaluated and applied to the treatment at stake. However, they are also the most expensive and regulated portions of a trial. It can cost up to two billion dollars just to complete these early phases of a clinical trial, and sometimes, they are even bypassed. If this does not occur, and a drug does go through Phase I and Phase IIA, corners can be proactively cut in order to decrease costs, meet regulatory requirements and ensure efficacy.&#10; &#10;The 2nd Clinical Trials Phase I and Phase IIA Summit will explore paramount strategies behind increasing efficiency in early phase clinical trials. As the early clinical development space is continuously evolving, this must-attend event will feature countless case studies and networking opportunities to address current challenges. In addition to hearing about pharmacokinetic, pharmacogenomic and pharmacovigilant methodologies, this conference will provide the audience with the opportunity to hear from top industry thought leaders in regards to driving success into their clinical trials.&#10;</field>

Jahrestagung der S?ddeutschen Gesellschaft f?r Kinder- und Jugendmedizin vom 8. bis 9. Mai 2015 in N?rnberg.&#10;&#10;Zusammen mit der S?ddeutschen Gesellschaft f?r Kinderchirurgie und dem Berufsverband der Kinder- und Jugend?rzte e.V. (Landesverband Bayern) werden wir Ihnen ein informatives Programm anbieten, welches in konzentrierter Form aktuelle Fragen der Kinder- und Jugendmedizin f?r klinisch interessierte Kolleginnen und Kollegen auf den Punkt bringt.&#10;&#10;Im Fokus stehen f?r uns zunehmend medizinische Probleme kranker Kinder mit Migrationshintergrund. Hier sind wir in bislang ungewohnter Weise mit seltenen Stoffwechselkrankheiten und mit seltenen h?matologischen und infektiologischen Krankheitsbildern konfrontiert.&#10;&#10;Ein weiterer Schwerpunkt unserer Tagung stellt die Schnittstelle zwischen Kinderheilkunde und Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie dar. Ziel ist es, den praktizierenden Kolleginnen und Kollegen aktuelle therapeutische M?glichkeiten und unterst?tzende Behandlungsma?nahmen aufzuzeigen.&#10;&#10;Das h?ufige Symptom des Schmerzes bei Kindern und Jugendlichen stellt uns immer wieder vor schwierige differentialdiagnostische ?berlegungen. Dieses Symptom soll von allen Seiten beleuchtet werden und effektive und effiziente Diagnosealgorithmen sollen aufgezeigt werden.&#10;&#10;Kinderurologische und kinderorthop?dische Fragestellungen, sowie moderne Verfahren der Sedierung und Schmerztherapie, stehen zunehmend im Mittelpunkt. Hier freuen wir uns, praktische wie klinisch relevante Strategien von ausgewiesenen Referenten pr?sentieren zu k?nnen.&#10;&#10;Mit einer bewusst ?bersichtlichen Auswahl an Seminarthemen einschlie?lich der M?glichkeit, die Qualifikation zum Neugeborenen-Notarzt zu erwerben, wollen wir Ihnen individuelle Fort- und Weiterbildungsthemen zur Abrundung anbieten.&#10;&#10;Wir hoffen sehr, dass Sie interessante Tage zwischen Wissenschaft und klinischer Praxis finden werden und freuen uns, Sie in N?rnberg begr??en zu d?rfen.&#10;&#10; </field>

The European Society of Anaesthesiology, the new ESA as we know it today, was born in January 2005 and has developed into a strong, dynamic and extremely successful medical society. The ESA has a worldwide reputation of professionalism and excellence and formally became the European Regional Section of the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists (WFSA) in July 2014. We will be celebrating 10 years of our society’s achievements during our flagship event in Berlin.&#10;&#10;We have grown to expect a state-of-the art educational and scientific programme at the annual congress. Once again Euroanaesthesia 2015 will not disappoint us. Under the joint leadership of Prof Stefan De Hert and Prof Charles Marc Samama, the Scientific Committee has elaborated an outstanding programme full of cutting edge innovations in basic and clinical science, innovation in clinical application, in education and in quality and safety improvement. Research from investigators around the world will be presented in special lectures, interactive sessions, as well as the traditional abstract-based programme with presentations in front of electronic poster boards. Pre-congress courses and workshops are as always an integral part of the Euroanaesthesia programme.&#10;&#10;A significant new approach to the programme is the reorganisation of the congress into 17 Learning Tracks based on topics, no longer following the structure of the Scientific Committee and its Subcommittees. As of Stockholm, the Scientific Subcommittee Meetings are open to all ESA members. We encourage you to attend and to contribute to the discussions. The schedule will be published in the Final Programme.&#10;&#10;The Basic Sciences Anaesthetic Course organised in parallel with the congress is growing in popularity. Please make sure your young colleagues are aware of this course which is invaluable in the preparation of the EDAIC exam. A Part II EDAIC exam session in English and German will be organised pre-congress so that candidates can also attend Euroanaesthesia. Places are limited so please register well before the January deadline.&#10;&#10;The Plenary Session highlight, the Sir Robert Macintosh Lecture, is well known for attracting inspirational and motivating speakers. This year is no exception. Professor Isabelle Murat, eminent paediatric anaesthesiologist, will share the knowledge and experience gained through her dedicated and reputed career. She has long campaigned to improve safety in paediatric anaesthesia worldwide and in particular in Africa and Asia. Professor Murat, a crusader for better care of children, will address the topical but controversial subject of anaesthesia moving to subspecialities.&#10;&#10;We trust that the combination of education, science, research, networking and socialising will make Euroanaesthesia 2015 another unforgettable event. We look forward to welcoming you to Berlin!&#10;</field>

It will explore the key beneficial contributions that some minor fatty acids, present at relatively low levels in the typical European diet, make to human development and health maintenance.&#10;&#10;The weekend before the conference will have Edinburgh hosting the Edinburgh marathon. Also we have timed the event, so that should they wish, delegates and go onto Reykjavik for the Nordic Lipids Forum Meeting which takes place from the 4th June.&#10;</field>

As you may or may not know, I will be your program chair for the 2015 ISMRM Annual Meeting in Toronto. Over the months that lead us to the annual meeting, you will receive several personal notes from me. These notes will be short!! – I know you are all super busy. In my tenure on the road to being program chair, I have tried to make my contributions to the annual meeting a representation of what the membership wants. You will see that the Toronto 2015 is YOUR meeting. The content reflects membership survey outcomes for plenary and educational content. And these personal notes will be no exception!!&#10;&#10;I will invite the membership to submit questions to be addressed or comments/ editorials to be featured that focus on the city of Toronto, or any part of the annual meeting. As special incentive to make this an interactive process, one featured membership question or comment/ editorial will be chosen by a panel (appointed by ME!!) to receive a complementary attraction passport AND one gift certificate from a local vendor. This was kindly provided by Tourism Toronto (Check them out HERE.)&#10;&#10;We are SO fortunate to have our annual meeting in Toronto. This is an AMAZING city that reflects the society in so many ways. It is considered a continental gateway and international crossroads, a city with diverse and colorful neighborhoods, with more than 100 cultures and lifestyles celebrated in Greater Toronto. As we correspond in the months to come, I will draw your attention to DIVERSITY and the sense of COMMUNITY in the city of Toronto, and in the ISMRM. We are visiting a city that we know as a society, a city that offers us familiarity, and welcomes us back with open arms. This offers us a unique opportunity to learn more about our destination, both physicially and as a society. I challenge you to focus on ways that our society can preserve its sense of community as we grow, stay connected with each other and nurture our diversity.</field>

While Nerve growth factor (NGF) was the first neurotrophic factor when it was identified more than 50 years ago, a large set of related and unrelated extracellular proteins are now known to exert neurotrophic effects in the developing and mature nervous system. The roles of neurotrophic factors include regulation of cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, migration, axon and dendrite growth, synaptic plasticity and the interactions of neuronal and glial cells. As a result, neurotrophic factors affect complex behaviors including feeding, anxiety, depression and learning, and aberrations in the activities of neurotrophic factors have been implicated in multiple neurologic and psychiatric disorders.&#10;&#10;The Neurotrophic Factors Gordon Conference provides a great opportunity to learn of recent advances in this broad field, and enhances collaborations among scientists and students. The meeting will feature work on diverse neurotrophic factors and their roles in neurogenesis, neuronal migration, survival, plasticity, behavior and diseases, including disorders of neural development such as autism and epilepsy and degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease and peripheral neuropathies. Emphasis will be placed on the most recent developments. </field>

Termed the Capital of Music this vibrant international city is visited by more than 5 million people every year. For four days in June 2015 we will again make Vienna the focal point of European ophthalmology and we expect nearly every tenth European ophthalmologist to attend the meeting. There is much more to Vienna than the Apfelstrudel, Wiener Schnitzel and the celebrated Sachertorte. Indeed, we will treat you with a huge smorgasbord featuring a wide range of ophthalmology dishes. This will no doubt serve as some serious food for thought.&#10;</field>

MicroRNAs act to promote or repress cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis during development, all processes that go awry in cancer. Thus, microRNAs have the ability to behave like oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Their small size and molecular properties make microRNAs amenable as targets and therapeutics in cancer treatment.&#10;&#10;MicroRNAs thus present a paradigm shift in thinking about gene regulation during development and disease and provide the oncologist with a potentially powerful new battery of agents to diagnose and treat cancer. However, while hundreds of human microRNAs and noncoding RNAs are known, relatively little is known about their roles and targets, and there is still a limited literature on using these molecules in the clinic.&#10;&#10;The specific aims of this meeting serve to address these deficiencies and are as follows:&#10;&#10;1) Focus on the exciting biology of microRNAs and noncoding RNAs in controlling developmental and cancer processes like cell proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle, apoptosis and metastasis. This meeting will highlight the best current research into the role that miRNAs play in these fundamental processes and provide the basic understanding that will drive the invention of powerful clinical tools;&#10;2) Focus on the latest efforts to harness the power of these RNAs as agents in the fight against cancer. Discussions will range from use of miRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic markers in cancer, to SNPs providing risk factors for cancer, to the delivery and effectiveness of small RNA therapeutics in clinically relevant settings;&#10;3) Attract the best researchers working in small RNAs and cancer to one place for critical discussions that will advance the field and accelerate the benchside to bedside use of this technology;&#10;4) Provide a stimulating environment where students, postdocs and junior investigators can present and discuss their research with the best minds in the field.&#10; </field>

Upon completion, participants should be able to diagnose, treat and perhaps prevent many of the infections commonly seen.  Topics include some of the newer antibiotics and antivirals used in the US in 2014, as well as specific pathogens commonly seen such in clinical practice.  The two case reports are taken from classic presentations of illnesses seen in an office practice with discussion of the literature and treatment.   With more of our families traveling we will also discuss travel advice including both antibiotics and vaccines indicated for the different regions of the world. Lastly we will discuss MRSA, a pathogen hitting our communities and children in ever increasing numbers.  There will be time for questions related to these topics as well as open discussion regarding pathogens of interest to the attendees. This seminar will be relevant to family practitioners, pediatricians, infectious disease specialists, as well as other health professionals who manage pediatric patients.</field>

The mechanisms of apoptosis have been extensively studied, but those of the elimination of apoptotic cells are much less understood. Apoptotic cells are rapidly engulfed and digested by their neighbors or by professional phagocytes in a process known as phagocytosis, clearance or efferocytosis. During development this process plays a key role in tissue morphogenesis and renewal. It also allows for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis in adults and promotes the resolution of inflammation. Failure to clear apoptotic cells can result in developmental defects, chronic inflammatory disorders, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. For example, it has been associated with Lupus, a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease, and with retinal degeneration. Dying cells can be cleared before completion of their programmed death, and failure in this process may result in cancer.&#10;&#10;A thorough understanding of efferocytosis is essential to design new therapies to prevent or treat chronic inflammation, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Some of the molecular mechanisms of apoptotic cell clearance are shared with those of pathogen clearance, and thus studying efferocytosis will also lead to new therapies to fight infections. This is critical since pathogens are becoming resistant to current treatments.&#10;&#10;At this Gordon Research Conference on Apoptotic Cell Recognition &amp; Clearance, we will discuss the latest advances made in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of apoptotic cell recognition and clearance in all model organisms, from worm, fly, fish and mouse, to mammalian (including human) cells in the context of both healthy and disease states.</field>

This is paradoxical as neurotropic pathogens are frequent in the developing world and contribute significantly to human suffering and disease burden. Moreover living with neurological handicap and/or cognitive dysfunction will have a significant impact on socio-economic development. As the central nervous system is usually not the primary target site of infection, a window of opportunity exists to interfere with pathogen spreading.&#10;&#10;The Gordon Research Conference on &quot;Infections of the nervous system&quot; will advance knowledge in the field and promote exchanges between medical research centers in resource-rich and -poor regions. The format of GRC (community-based, small audience, focus on unpublished material) is ideal to create a multidisciplinary dialogue that will involve both clinicians and scientists studying disease mechanisms and host genetics, the molecular make-up of neurotropic infectious agents, and the innate and adaptive immune response to neurotropic pathogens. In addition, groups working on developing new technologies for diagnosis and prognosis will be included.&#10;&#10;This new series will bring together renowned clinicians and scientists, who investigate clinical disease manifestations and the molecular mechanisms underlying worldwide infections of the nervous system in humans. This will foster collaborations to accelerate/expand investigations and use new technologies allowing fast development of diagnostic/prognostic tools and pioneering drug discoveries.</field>

Combining the two fields has been beneficial because, while fungi and algae are very different microorganisms, they and their toxins nonetheless present common scientific challenges. The conference serves as a forum for scientists sharing the goal of reducing health risks and economic losses caused by these toxins in foods, feeds and the environment, for sharing the latest data, for developing novel approaches to ongoing problems, and for identifying new toxin-related research needs. The conference has a history of generous support from the USDA, FDA, NIEHS, NOAA, other government entities and corporations.&#10;&#10;Myco- and phycotoxin research requires a multidisciplinary approach incorporating chemistry, microbiology, ecology, genetics, agronomy, pharmacology, toxicology, molecular biology, epidemiology and other fields. A major strength of the Mycotoxin and Phycotoxin Conference is the high level of scientific expertise from these fields represented at the meetings. Among the conference topics are: identification and characterization of toxigenic microorganisms and their toxins, biosynthetic pathways, genetic-biomolecular controls of biosynthesis, and environmental triggers for toxin production. Additional topics include development of rapid, sensitive and cost effective analytical methods, novel biomarkers and improved exposure assessments for vulnerable animal and human populations, toxicology and mechanisms of action, risk assessment, and reducing exposures through the development of effective intervention strategies.&#10;&#10;The introduction of students and young scientists to the mycotoxin and phycotoxin research communities is another important aspect of the conference. By providing a venue for them to discuss their research with experts and to build professional relationships, the conference contributes to the continuity of myco- and phycotoxin research. In summary, through a unique combination of toxins, scientific disciplines, experts and young scientists, the Mycotoxin and Phycotoxin GRC serves as a catalyst for research having the ultimate goal of maintaining a safe food supply and environment.</field>

Presentations will provide a common framework for collaboration between treatment and neuroimaging researchers by covering conceptual, methodological, and clinical issues relevant to studying brain-based mechanisms that underlie effective behavioral interventions. The meeting aims to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration to accelerate translational research.&#10;&#10;Registration is free and required to attend.&#10;&#10;Please register by May 1, 2015 on the conference website.&#10;&#10;Support: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, University of Pittsburgh Department of Psychiatry, University of New Mexico Department of Psychiatry, National Center for Responsible Gaming&#10;</field>

Today, Berlin is one of the world’s most vibrant capitals, with an impressive cultural, scientific and economic scene, attracting politicians and business travellers, start-ups and artists, tourists and connoisseurs from around the globe. The city is also emerging as the centre of German healthcare, last but not least due to the Charité Hospital, the largest clinic in Europe, counting 3200 beds and 7000 medical and healthcare students and many medical research institutes.&#10;&#10;Berlin has a long neurological history. It was here that Moritz Heinrich Romberg wrote the ‘Lehrbuch der Nervenkrankheiten des Menschen’, a frontier breaking mid-19th century textbook which is seen as the foundation of modern neurology. Almost 25 years after the fall of the wall, the once divided city of Berlin today symbolizes peaceful revolution, the overthrow of outworn systems and the venture into a new political era. The 1st Congress of the EAN will also write European neurological history. EAN is the joint subsequent organisation of the EFNS (European Federation of Neurological Societies) and ENS (European Neurological Society), and thereby the first united voice of European Neurology. This founding act was celebrated on June 3rd, 2014 at the Joint Congress of European Neurology in Istanbul. The first congress of this new Society will be celebrated in the united Berlin.&#10;&#10;The EAN Congress in Berlin will provide the ideal platform for continuing education in all fields of neurology, covering a broad spectrum of topics with state-of-the-art lectures by renowned experts. The EAN is dedicated to providing the highest quality of continuing medical education and to opening professional education opportunities. We are deeply grateful to the Programme Committee and their chairpersons Jacques L. De Reuck and Gustave Moonen and to the many people organizing this major event.&#10;&#10;We are looking forward to welcoming you to Berlin in 2015,&#10;</field>

Despite these results, most cancers treated with single agents rapidly acquire resistance through a variety of mechanisms, severely limiting clinical benefit.&#10;&#10;This conference will have presentations ranging across the identification of novel drug targets; non-oncogene addiction and synthetic lethality; discovery of drug resistance mechanisms; the development of combinatorial therapies; and related translational topics, across a wide spectrum of cancer types.&#10;&#10;&#10;Important dates:&#10;&#10;    Abstract submission6 February 2015&#10;    Standard registration24 February 2015&#10;&#10;&#10;</field>

Today, Berlin is one of the world’s most vibrant capitals, with an impressive cultural, scientific and economic scene, attracting politicians and business travellers, start-ups and artists, tourists and connoisseurs from around the globe. The city is also emerging as the centre of German healthcare, last but not least due to the Charité Hospital, the largest clinic in Europe, counting 3200 beds and 7000 medical and healthcare students and many medical research institutes.&#10;&#10;Berlin has a long neurological history. It was here that Moritz Heinrich Romberg wrote the ‘Lehrbuch der Nervenkrankheiten des Menschen’, a frontier breaking mid-19th century textbook which is seen as the foundation of modern neurology. Almost 25 years after the fall of the wall, the once divided city of Berlin today symbolizes peaceful revolution, the overthrow of outworn systems and the venture into a new political era. The 1st Congress of the EAN will also write European neurological history. EAN is the joint subsequent organisation of the EFNS (European Federation of Neurological Societies) and ENS (European Neurological Society), and thereby the first united voice of European Neurology. This founding act was celebrated on June 3rd, 2014 at the Joint Congress of European Neurology in Istanbul. The first congress of this new Society will be celebrated in the united Berlin.&#10;&#10;The EAN Congress in Berlin will provide the ideal platform for continuing education in all fields of neurology, covering a broad spectrum of topics with state-of-the-art lectures by renowned experts. The EAN is dedicated to providing the highest quality of continuing medical education and to opening professional education opportunities. We are deeply grateful to the Programme Committee and their chairpersons Jacques L. De Reuck and Gustave Moonen and to the many people organizing this major event.&#10;&#10;We are looking forward to welcoming you to Berlin in 2015,&#10;</field>

The aim of the Association was to advance education in all aspects of plastic surgery.&#10;&#10;Today, these objectives remain. However, techniques and expertise have progressed to the extent that plastic surgery needs to be understood in a modern, wider context. While the majority of plastic surgery work is reconstructive, restoring form and function following illness or trauma, the world knows that some is aesthetic or ‘cosmetic&apos;, where people elect for plastic surgery to change form or appearance. As innovative techniques develop, both reconstructive and aesthetic plastic surgery inform each other. The one improves the other, and vice versa, which can only be in the interest of all patients.&#10;&#10;As the voice of plastic surgery, BAPRAS sees its role as increasing understanding of the scope of plastic surgery. We aim to raise the profile of plastic surgeons as an intrinsic element of care teams providing specialist care to patients with a wide range of conditions. Continuing our objective of advancing education, BAPRAS is always looking to promote innovation within the speciality of plastic surgery.</field>

Initially the focus was on discovery of hepatitis viruses, then it was the development of diagnostic procedures, vaccines, understanding pathophysiology and now therapies. In 2015 will be the time when many of the new direct antiviral agents (DAAs) against hepatitis C will be approved. However public health will become very important to identify the patients in need for therapy and to make these new therapies accessible to all parts of the world. Furthermore we still need to develop better finite therapies for hepatitis B and need to address many more burning issues of global relevance like hepatitis D and E. &#10;&#10;This symposium is organized every three years moving around the continents. Basic scientists and clinicians will discuss the most recent advances made against the global health burden caused by all hepatitis viruses. For the first time the symposium will be organized in Germany taking place in its capital Berlin. &#10;&#10;Our vision and ambition is to make it a true GLOBAL VIRAL HEPATITIS SUMMIT. &#10;&#10;We look forward to welcoming you in Berlin in June 2015!&#10;&#10;Professor Michael P. Manns, MD&#10;Congress President, ISVHLD 2015&#10;</field>

Early leaders identified areas of interest that have since become pillars of the curriculum for wilderness medicine education, including CME programs, medical school rotations, outdoor programs and FAWM criteria (see below). In addition to the Society’s annual meeting, it also sponsors topic specific meetings (e.g. Winter Wilderness Medicine and Dive Medicine) and the quadrennial World Congress in Wilderness Medicine.&#10;&#10;The written word has been a cornerstone of the WMS since its early history. Today’s publications include, Wilderness Medicine (WM) magazine, Wilderness &amp; Environmental Medicine, the Society’s peer-reviewed journal, Wilderness Medical Society: Practice Guidelines for Emergency Care, and the WMS Educational Lecture Series. The commitment of the WMS to embrace academic excellence and to deliver innovative services to its members shines with the inception and creation of the Academy of Wilderness Medicine. In one of the fastest growing segments of membership, Student Interest Groups, lies the hope for the future and sustaining the Society for years to come.</field>

Because of its ties to both of these traditional areas of chemistry, new developments in Organometallic Chemistry impact both inorganic and organic chemistry and applications of organometallic chemistry often have effects that reach far beyond these boundaries. The Organometallic Chemistry Gordon Research Conference will highlight cutting edge developments in basic science and applications including synthesis, reactivity, catalysis, and bonding theory.&#10;&#10;Solutions to some of the major issues that face modern society such as the production of alternative fuels, chemistry to mitigate climate change and the development of new drugs will likely have components that are a direct result of organometallic chemistry. With its collegial atmosphere, and plenty of opportunity for discussion during the program, at poster sessions and social gatherings, this conference provides a fertile setting for discussion of these large issues amongst researchers from different fields. Participants will include a diverse group of scientists, doing research at the cutting edge of their fields from the US and abroad, ranging from senior investigators to junior scientists and graduate students.&#10;&#10;&#10;</field>

This conference is designed to facilitate shared insights among attendees and fuel further advances in our understanding of the mechanisms governing the formation, behavior and differentiation of these two cell populations, as well as to catalyze the application of this knowledge to the field of regenerative medicine. The central goals of the conference are to accelerate the exchange of information across different model systems, to promote technological innovations in the field, and to further a genome and proteome scale understanding of the mechanisms that govern the development of neural crest cells and cranial sensory placodes.&#10;&#10;Both neural crest cells and cranial placode cells make extensive contributions to embryonic structures, and defects in their development underlie a broad range of congenital disorders. Neural crest cells display stem cell attributes, and neural crest-derived cells persist as stem cells into adulthood; studies of these cells provide broad insights into stem cell biology. Moreover, neural crest cells undergo migratory and invasive behavior driven by core EMT regulatory factors, and understanding how their behavior is regulated provides insights into the related invasive behavior of metastatic tumor cells. Cranial placode cells play important roles in the development of cranial sensory structures; mutations in genes that regulate their development lead to human syndromes with severe sensory deficits and dysregulated cell cycle control in numerous cancers. The conference will bring together a diverse group of scientists in a collegial atmosphere that fosters substantive discussions and promotes collaborative interactions between basic and clinical scientists in this important area of biomedical research.</field>

Pancreatic neoplasms are among the most malignant and untreatable forms of cancer. The inability of pancreatic beta cells to supply insulin in amounts adequate to meet metabolic needs is the ultimate cause of all forms of diabetes. The epidemic increase of this disease represents a major threat to human health and society. Diabetes often precedes pancreatic cancer and is thus regarded as a potential risk factor for malignancy.&#10;&#10;Chronic pancreatitis, in turn, can result in the disruption of pancreatic islets and diabetes. Lineage-tracing studies in mice are unraveling the transcriptional program and signaling pathways presiding pancreatic organogenesis and the specification of its exocrine and endocrine components. This information is being exploited to devise protocols for the differentiation of embryonic stem/induced-pluripotent stem cells into pancreatic beta cells for the regenerative therapy of diabetes. Moreover, pancreatic ductal and acinar cells are being considered as potential sources for regeneration/transdifferentiation of pancreatic beta cells.&#10;&#10;Hence, the broad scope of this conference is to support the development of a multidisciplinary research community addressing medical, biological, chemical and pharmacological topics related to the diversity and complexity of pancreatic diseases. This long-term objective will be achieved through a series of conferences, in which the emphasis of the various topics will vary overtime depending on the most recent and promising discoveries on pancreatic biology and diseases. Progress will be further fostered through the selected invitation of highly ranked investigators from other scientific areas. Through the contribution of leading experts, we expect to identify novel concepts for the pharmacological and cell-based treatment of pancreatic diseases. To set the stage for this ambitious program, the kick-off conference of this series will deliberately cover the wide-spectrum of pancreatic diseases, with emphasis on regenerative medicine.&#10;&#10;Future topics of special interests will include, but not be restricted to: a) novel insight into the cell biology and physiology of pancreatic cells; b) signaling pathways connecting pancreatic cells to other gastrointestinal organs and the nervous system; c) the contribute of environmental agents (e.g. nutrients, pathogens and toxic agents) towards the development of pancreatic diseases; d) genetic and epigenetic susceptibility to pancreatic disorders; e) biomarkers for the prevention, early diagnosis, and personalized treatment of pancreatic diseases; f) inflammation and pancreatic diseases and autoimmune pancreatitis. &#10;</field>

First organized in 1955, the Molecular and Cellular Biology of Lipids conference is among the oldest continuous Gordon Conference meetings.&#10;&#10;The meeting will cover a broad range of topics, including lipid signals that regulate cell metabolism, new roles for lipases and acyltransferases in obesity, atherosclerosis and inflammation, membrane biogenesis and turnover, cellular lipid metabolism, fatty acid uptake and metabolism, transcriptional control of lipids, novel roles for phosphatidic acid, and genetic regulation of lipid enzymes by miRNAs.&#10;&#10;The invited speakers will represent both well-established senior investigators and energetic junior investigators who are pioneering new approaches, thereby generating an atmosphere guaranteed to stimulate lively discussions. The biochemists, structural biologists, cell biologists, physiologists, nutrition scientists, and geneticists who attend this conference will derive synergistic benefit from the high quality of the speakers, the diverse experimental expertise of the participants, the abundant opportunities for interactions. Because lipid metabolism is fundamental to normal growth and development, to cellular responses to external stimuli, and to disorders related to obesity, atherosclerosis, aging, inflammation, and the metabolic syndrome, basic research in this field has a far ranging impact with profound consequences for many other fields.&#10;</field>

Over the years to follow, the breadth of the field has grown even more due to identification and study of numerous additional molecules that influence the regulation, assembly and function of elastic fibers, such as the fibulins, latent TGF-beta binding proteins, emilins, proteoglycans and lysyl oxidases.&#10;&#10;The Conference is unique in the depth of its coverage of elastin biology, spanning from detailed, high-resolution structural studies of elastin and fibrillin, to in vitro assembly assays, to functional in vivo research with transgenic and knockout animals, to human disease, and finally to biomaterials and therapies. The unusual biology of elastic fibers has brought together basic scientists with diverse areas of expertise, including physical chemistry, engineering, cell and molecular biology, developmental biology, biochemistry and biotechnology. Furthermore, because of the involvement of elastin and elastic fiber associated proteins in numerous pathological processes, past Gordon Conferences have attracted investigators with a wide spectrum of clinical interests, including emphysema, COPD, pulmonary and vascular hypertension, atherosclerosis, aneurysms, genetic diseases, and cutaneous and eye diseases.&#10;&#10;Over the years, the content and focus of the Elastin and Elastic Fibers GRC has been constantly evolving, reflecting changing trends and ideas. Attendees of previous conferences enthusiastically agree that this meeting provides the most important forum for communication and collaboration among investigators in this field. As such, this conference has had, and will continue to have, a major role in stimulating interest and influencing the direction of research in this field.</field>

Angiogenesis contributes to the emergence and progression of cancer in a complex manner and unraveling the molecular details will have a significant impact on current and future drug development. We also need to determine the composite consequence of angiogenesis inhibition in the setting of cancer in order to provide optimal information to aid therapy development in the clinic.&#10;&#10;Angiogenesis research will provide better biomarkers to predict and monitor anti-angiogenesis therapy in our patients. This conference is being designed to address the most vital areas pertinent to angiogenesis, seeking to stimulate interactions among the experts and importantly provide invaluable educational opportunity for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and junior investigators.&#10;</field>

Set in glorious locations, in luxury four and five-star accommodation, each conference aims to bring together a range of expertise, from Academia to Industry, from the Professional to the Student, and provide a beautiful and serene environment in which to present and discuss their respective work. Zing Conferences is the promotion of inter-disciplinary communication; of the successful cross-pollination of theories and research amongst the many allied scientific fields. To promote this free exchange and dissemination of new ideas and research, all delegates are invited to compete for a place in the main lecture programme, of some 40 speakers, or to present their work as part of the larger Posters sessions by submitting abstracts for Chair-lead consideration.&#10;&#10;Jane Hill, is Zing’s Managing Director. Jane has worked in the tourist industry for many years, starting as one of the youngest airhostess’s in the business, working her way up to a managerial position in an Events and Sales company. Originally when joining Zing she handled pretty much everything solo but as time has gone by more staff were brought on. “I now have a fantastic team and even though we have grown to cope with our extensive range of conferences, we are still small enough to care.”</field>

Developing a means to more specifically treat and ideally prevent hormone-dependent cancers is of critical importance given the significant impact these malignancies have on human health and the economic burden of disease.&#10;&#10;An in depth understanding of hormone action in regulating diverse cellular processes, cancer phenotypes and drug responsiveness is essential for the development of effective and well tolerated treatment strategies.&#10;&#10;The 2015 GRC is designed to maximize interaction between participants, in order to engender creativity and cross-fertilization of ideas across multiple disciplines while fostering mentorship of early career scientists. Scientists and clinicians from both academia and industry with expertise in contemporary ‘omics’, transcriptional control, cell signaling, human disease modeling and clinical translation will provide a stimulating and engaging format for interaction and fruitful exchange of scientific ideas common to overlapping research fields, such that novel concepts emerge, scientific collaborations are formed, and new translational opportunities are revealed.</field>

While some of these lung diseases have an obvious developmental component, there is growing appreciation that processes and pathways critical for normal lung development are also important for postnatal tissue homeostasis and are dysregulated in lung disease.&#10;&#10;The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Lung Development, Injury and Repair is designed to provide a diverse group of scientists, spanning the basic to clinical research spectrum, with the latest developments on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of normal lung development and injury-repair processes, and how they are dysregulated in disease.&#10;&#10;The conference will emphasize similarities and distinctions in regulatory pathways that impact lung development and postnatal tissue homeostasis, and how these pathways are dysregulated in the setting of tissue remodeling and lung disease. Some unique features of this conference are the breadth of topics covered, a focus on emerging technologies and therapeutic opportunities, and the high degree of interaction among basic and clinician scientists.</field>

Diseases of the immune system and the musculoskeletal diseases frequently are recognized in young and middle aged individuals, however the epidemiology is changing and it is common to see elderly individuals with autoimmune diseases including vasculitis and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, musculoskeletal diseases such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, while they are major diseases of the elderly can often be the result of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.&#10;&#10;This conference will focus on the cells that control the immune system, their function in health, disease and aging, and the role of inflammation on musculoskeletal diseases of aging. At the end of this conference the participants will understand immune cell function in health and disease, and aging. The format of this conference will include plenary sessions with related abstracts presented by participants, daily poster sessions, and free time to network, discuss and reflect on the ideas presented at the conference.</field>

This creates an exciting series of challenges and opportunities to be addressed by discussion and exchange of ideas. There has to our knowledge never been a basic research conference devoted to Parkinson’s, and this conference will bring together investigators with diverse scientific backgrounds who share an interest in the cellular mechanisms that produce PD and its related disorders. The specific content of the Conference will evolve as our understanding of PD evolves.&#10;&#10;For the first Conference, topics will include: The normal function of PD-related genes; The cellular response to toxic protein aggregates; Endoplasmic reticulum stress; Proteasomal and autophagic processes; Neuroimmune pathways; and Prion-like aggregate pathogenesis.&#10; </field>

Speakers in the symposium have until Thursday, October 30th, to submit their individual abstract&#10;&#10;&#10;ABOUT SOBP&#10; &#10;The Society of Biological Psychiatry was founded in l945 to encourage the study of the biological causes of and treatments for psychiatric disorders.  Its continuing purpose is to promote excellence in scientific research and education in fields that investigate the nature, causes, mechanisms, and treatments of disorders of thought, emotion, or behavior.&#10;&#10;To achieve its purpose, the Society creates venues for the exchange of scientific information that will foster the advancement of psychiatric neuroscience and therapeutics. To this end, the Society sponsors an annual meeting, maintains web-based resources, grants awards to distinguished clinical and basic researchers, and publishes the journal, Biological Psychiatry.The term “biological psychiatry” emphasizes the biological nature of behavior and its disorders and implies the use of the medical model; but in so doing, it encompasses other major elements of modern psychiatric medicine, including its humanitarian mission, psychological foundation, and socio-cultural orientation.&#10;&#10;The vision of the Society of Biological Psychiatry is to be the leading professional organization in the integration, advancement, and promulgation of science relevant to psychiatric disorders, with the ultimate goal of reducing or preventing the suffering of those with these disorders.&#10;&#10; </field>

Our first forum - “Up and Up: A Forum on Community Care” in 2013 - was attended by more than 800 foreign and local delegates including many esteemed speakers from the USA, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore. It generated lively debates, seeded many new ideas and had many engaging discussions on health technology, end of life care and innovative approaches to dementia care.&#10;&#10;Our second edition will centre on how our intermediate and long term care sector can be even more cohesive and integrated, and to imagine (further!), rethink (deeper!), and develop (better!) models of care and services. You will be inspired to deliver better, safer and more timely care to your clients and caregivers.&#10;&#10;There will be 3 main conference tracks – Community Care; Imagine, Dream and Evaluate; and Caregiver Well-Being and Mental Health. They will tinker your grey cells and nimble hands to do more to encourage greater multi-sectorial rethinking of aged and mental health care through a trans-disciplinary approach, borrowing from medicine, health sciences, social sciences, architecture, design as well as communications.&#10;&#10;The main conference will be complemented by several pre-conference workshops to be held on 14 May 2015. These workshops will cover topics such as End-of-life Care, Dementia Care and Motivational Interviewing.  These skills-based workshops will allow participants to gain a better understanding of knowledge and acquire new skills through highly stimulating and interactive experiential platforms.&#10;&#10;This forum will be beneficial to all allied healthcare professionals, physicians, nurses, social care professionals, health administrators and civil society players from Singapore and the Asia Pacific. It will be an invaluable opportunity for all to share and learn from each other, as well as collaborate to plan for a future of good and cost-effective care.&#10;&#10;We look forward to see you at this exciting Forum!</field>

Under the theme of “Nutrition and Food for Longevity: For the Well-Being of All”, the Congress focuses on the expansion of collaborative ties among Asian countries and with our international colleagues.&#10;&#10;The science of food and nutrition has had a drastic role change in recent times as it has evolved into a truly multidisciplinary science, encompassing work from consumer research to materials technology to process engineering, among other fields.&#10;&#10;Nutrition and food scientists must take note of the health trends, environmental concerns and the changing economic climate. In developing countries, the problems of famine and malnutrition are still a huge burden, while in developed countries, the increase in obesity and lifestyle-related diseases has become a major issue, and the public concern has shifted from deficiency to overnutrition during the last half century.&#10;&#10;Given these considerations, the promotion of joint initiatives to improve the understanding and cooperation between societies in nearby countries is welcome. We have a number of latent advantages that should allow us to do this; such as a foundation of good clinical research and talented researchers who can advance the collective knowledge about food and nutrition.&#10;&#10;The scientific program of the Congress is comprised of symposia and workshops including invitational plenary sessions, special lectures and debates on the current problems of human nutrition and food sciences. &#10;</field>

This annual event is the preeminent forum for enhancing one’s veterinary education by way of a cutting edge scientific program.??????&#10;&#10;The World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) is an ‘association of associations’. Its membership is made up of veterinary organisations from all over the world which are concerned with small companion animals such as cats, dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs, etc. &#10;&#10;WSAVA’s primary purpose is to advance the quality and availability of small animal medicine and surgery.  This broad aim is achieved in a number of different ways. WSAVA fosters the exchange of scientific information, both between individual veterinarians and between their veterinary organisations. &#10;&#10;Each year, an Annual WSAVA World Congress is held in a different part of the world, hosted by a member association under the auspices of WSAVA. The Congress attracts large numbers of vets and veterinary nurses/technicians from many countries. Participants learn from top international speakers on all aspects of small animal practice. Proceedings from the Congress are available to veterinary schools, libraries and individuals, and provide a valuable source of the most up to date knowledge. </field>

With input from our membership, some of the topics to be included are the discovery of surfactant, advances in bronchoscopy, insights into asthma pathogenesis and the potential of lung regeneration.  We are confident that there will be something of interest to everyone.  The lecturers, themselves contributors to these milestones, will not only look back but also forward to the opportunities these discoveries hold.&#10;&#10;Similarly, the ATS 2015 President’s Symposium, “How to Cure a Lung Disease: The Cystic Fibrosis Story,” will review how our understanding of cystic fibrosis lung disease has rapidly advanced, which has led to clinical trials with novel agents that are changing the lives of patients. Cystic fibrosis serves as a roadmap for other respiratory diseases, and this session will show how partnerships between patient organizations, clinicians, scientists, and industry can be transformative.&#10;&#10;Still the preeminent scientific conference in our fields, the ATS International Conference has evolved over the past decade to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse group of researchers, clinicians, educators, and public health experts.  At ATS 2015, you will find:&#10;&#10;    Adult and pediatric clinical core curriculums to ensure that busy clinicians have a systematic way of keeping abreast of changes in their field.&#10;    ABIM and ABP Maintenance of Certification points and credits are expected to be offered to those attending these core sessions.&#10;    A basic science core that explores over several days the importance of host pathogen interactions and host defense and features presenters from both inside and outside our Society.&#10;    A more interactive Exhibit Hall that adds another learning dimension.&#10;    And opportunities to apply knowledge through hands-on demonstrations.&#10;&#10;Most importantly, we believe, you will find a dedicated and collegial community that can inspire each of us to make a difference in patient’s lives, now and in the future, in the places we work and around the world.&#10;</field>

The principal functions attributed to B cells is their ability to differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibodies against antigens, and eventually develop into memory B cells. Long-lived plasma cells (PC) and memory B cells are the cells responsible for maintaining serological memory against childhood vaccines or infections previously met in life. However, as appreciation of the multifunctional nature of the B cells grows, their importance to health and disease is re-evaluated.&#10;&#10;An increasing emphasis is being placed on studying the multiple interactions of the microenvironment with differentiating B cells, from the earliest progenitor stage to fully differentiated plasma cells. Microenvironmental “cues” encompass signals from commensal microbiota and stimulatory and survival factors derived from interacting cells. In normal individuals, the pool of peripheral B cells is constant in size. The control of B, PC and memory B cell homeostasis is the result of a very fine balance between their maturation, proliferation and survival. Micro-environmental factors have been shown to play a critical role in maintaining lymphocyte homeostasis. Pathways and mechanisms that govern normal differentiation and survival of B cells can sometimes become dysregulated and drive pathogenic processes such as hematopoietic malignancies and autoimmune diseases.&#10;&#10;A variety of techniques are disposable for studying the regulation of B-cell maintenance and survival in health and disease. These techniques and methodologies span a broad range of &quot;classical&quot; disciplines such as bacteriology, virology, cell biology, immunology, histology, biochemistry and chemistry. In addition, high-throughput sequencing, mathematical modelling and informatics will be applied expanding the multidisciplinary aspect of this proposal beyond methods of classical biology.&#10;&#10;In this conference we will bring together eminent clinicians, biologists, mathematicians, biophysicists to discuss the explosion of paradigm-shifting discoveries in B cell biology and their relevance to healthy immunity. Basic mechanisms of B cell survival, differentiation, effector function and death will be reviewed during this event.  We will also focus on how alteration in these pathways may lead to pathology and to the abnormal B cell responses observed in cancer, infection and autoimmunity. Some of the invited lectures will illustrate how the elucidation of molecular pathways operating in B cells and governing proliferation, homeostasis and cell death may lead to novel immunotherapeutic strategies to ameliorate pathological conditions in experimental models and humans. &#10;</field>

		<field name="details">  Full Address:&#10;&#10;    Sagebrush Inn and Conference Center&#10;    1508 Paseo Del Pueblo Sur&#10;    Taos&#10;    87571&#10;    United States&#10;&#10;Events details:&#10;&#10;address zoom map&#10; &#10;Event details&#10;&#10;SIGNIFICANCE:&#10;&#10;The study of developmental signaling pathways has transformed our understanding of disease. The Hippo signaling pathway is a relatively novel signaling network that controls organ size, stem cell activity, and tumorigenesis. Therefore, the Hippo cascade and its components are attractive targets for the development of regenerative medicine and cancer drugs. The emerging paradigm in the field indicates that the Hippo pathway is a central sensor of multiple biological inputs, including cell adhesion, polarity, mechanical forces, and secreted ligands.&#10;&#10;These findings highlight the unique interdisciplinary nature of the field as the work from Drosophila geneticists, mammalian signalers, bioengineers, and developmental and cancer biologists needs to be integrated. These emerging paradoxes, the cancer and stem cell relevance of the pathway, and need for a larger forum to bring experts from multiple fields together prompted us to propose this meeting.&#10;&#10;The specific goals of this conference are to:&#10;1) Identify and integrate evolutionary conserved inputs that control this cascade;&#10;2) Define the transcriptional targets of the pathway that drive growth;&#10;3) Understand the roles of Hippo in the physiology of multiple tissues;&#10;4) Define targets for chemical inhibitors and activators within pathway components.&#10;&#10;INNOVATION: This meeting follows on the 2013 Hippo Keystone meeting, which has been received with tremendous interest. This is the only conference specific to the Hippo field. The meeting will bring together Drosophila geneticists, basic and clinical cancer researchers, and the developmental and stem cell research community. It should consolidate the emerging field and have an impact on development of new cancer therapies.&#10;</field>

Topics may include, but are not limited to:&#10;&#10;- What is neural enhancement, exactly? Is it a significantly new notion or simply an old idea that makes use of new technologies?&#10;- Enhancement is sometimes described as a means to make people &quot;better than well&quot;. What exactly does it mean to be &quot;better than well&quot;?&#10;- In what ways does neural enhancement affect a person’s identity?&#10;- What are the social, political and legal ramifications of making neural enhancement technologies available?&#10;- What questions are raised by the use of biomedical moral enhancers? Can such techniques/products genuinely improve the moral character of a person? What does moral mean if moral actions are the result of moral enhancers?&#10;- If biomedical enhancements worked, is a person morally obligated to use them? Is the state permitted to mandate their use, on adults or children or both?&#10;- Are &quot;enhancement&quot; techniques a form of eugenics? Why or why not? If so, is there anything morally objectionable about them?&#10;- Do individuals have the right to &quot;enhance&quot; themselves? Do parents have the right (the obligation?) to biomedically and/or neurologically enhance their children—in utero or ex utero? Both?&#10;- What counts as psychosurgery (sometimes referred to as neurosurgery for mental disorder, NMD)? What purposes should it serve? What mental illnesses or disorders should be treated with this method, if any? Does NMD raise any particular ethical problems or questions?&#10;- Rates of psychosurgery vary dramatically from country to country. What social factors influence psychosurgical practices?&#10;- What social and legal questions are raised by the practice of psychosurgery? Does it influence questions of a person’s legal or moral accountability? If so, why?&#10;- What questions of personal identity are raised by psychosurgery?&#10;- What issues of consent are raised by psychosurgery?&#10;- Should people convicted of crimes have the option (the right?) to opt for psychosurgery to reduce (replace?) a prison sentence? Can psychosurgery be performed on individuals to ensure they are fit to stand trial and/or be justly punished for crimes committed? Should we conceive of psychosurgery as treatment or punishment?&#10; </field>

Visser, of the Netherlands, and the co-chair, Christina Greenaway, from nearby Montreal, the Scientific Program Committee is putting together an up-to-date and broad-ranging program that no one will want to miss. We should remember that many of the talks at a conference like this present information that is not available in journals. They represent expert summaries of new information, or comprehensive reviews of the history of a current problem. That’s one of the main reasons it is important to make the effort to attend these meetings.&#10;&#10;In addition, as I’ve pointed out before, the irreplaceable benefit of coming to our international travel medicine meeting is to make connections, to put faces to names on the listserv, to meet people from all over the world, to ask questions and give answers to numerous small questions that arise in conversation between sessions. This meeting represents one of our main chances to interact with colleagues. It is remarkable to think about how international our society is, and what it means to come together for the benefit of all the people who travel around the world, and face the risks of doing so.&#10;&#10;With dozens of premier restaurants within walking distance of the venue, the chances to pursue these new and old friendships will be plentiful. I’m personally looking forward to meeting all of you at a meeting that will be scientifically valuable, and memorable on a lot of levels.</field>

Following the success of previous meetings, the scientific programme will focus on Symposia and Instructional Lectures given by distinguished speakers, as well as on Free Paper submissions from all over the world.&#10; &#10;The main theme of the EFORT Congress in Prague will be Infection. The result of an orthopaedic surgery can be sometimes overshadowed by early or late infection occurring in approximately 3-4 % of TJA and even more often after fracture fixation. Awareness of the infection problem, knowledge on how to prevent it and the use of up to date diagnostics and treatment algorithms is paramount. Highlights of the congress include musculoskeletal infections, current issues in tribology, infected TKR, complex injuries around the elbow, musculoskeletal tumours, knee injuries in children, DDH and other congenital deformities only to mentioned a few. In collaboration with our Speciality Societies, we will be organising sessions which have been highly rated in the past, not to mention the one-day Comprehensive Review Course (CRC) aimed at younger colleagues and residents and without forgetting the Michael Freeman and Erwin Morscher Honorary Lectures. Industry symposia, workshops and industry exhibits will also be a major part of our Congress.&#10; &#10;The scientific programme would, however, be incomplete without your participation, without Free Paper presentations and Wall Posters. We encourage all of you to submit abstracts of your work, so that we can put together an exceptional scientific programme.

Papers, Posters, Workshops and Panels are presented to educate the scientific and artistic communities about advances being made in voice science and care. The program is designed to foster future researchers and teachers.  It is a CME and CEU -accredited Voice Symposium from May 28 through June 1, 2014.&#10;&#10;As part of the symposium, we give young researchers an opportunity to talk with and learn from senior scientists by first presenting their research as posters and, as they progress, as oral presentations. We offer research awards (Van Lawrence Fellowship, Sataloff Young Investigator Award, Hamdan International Presenters Award and Best Paper Awards in three disciplines) and recognition for Best Poster presentations in three disciplinary areas including Basic Science of the Voice, Clinical Medicine, and Speech-Language Pathology/Vocal Pedagogy as well as an overall best.&#10;&#10;During the symposium, the New Investigators Research Forum gives two young researchers the opportunity to present their research-in-progress to the world’s most respected scientists in the field for feedback.&#10;&#10;More than 400 voice care professionals attend, including a strong faculty attendance from hospitals and universities world-wide. Papers presented at this Symposium educate the public and the scientific community on the latest advances in voice science and care.</field>

While it remains a fledging society, the WSACS has arguably accomplished a great deal in its first three years including the development of evidence-based medicine consensus definitions and recommendations statements, publication of the first textbook on ACS as well as a monograph of cutting-edge research findings, and development of a worldwide network of clinicians and research scientists.&#10; &#10;In May 2015 we will be organizing the 7th World Congress on the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome where we will review the current status of IAH and ACS in clinical practice, review contemporary diagnosis and management, as well as discuss new challenges and solutions.&#10; &#10;The 7th WCACS will focus on:&#10;&#10;    Prevention and early detection of IAH and ACS&#10;    New insights in the epidemiology and pathophysiology of IAH&#10;    IAH outside of the ICU&#10;    Disease specific IAH e.g. burns, pancreatitis, liver disease&#10;    IAH and ACS in children&#10;    IAH and fluid resuscication&#10;    Abdominal decompression - indications and limitations&#10;    Open abdomen management&#10;    Abdominal wall reconstruction.&#10;&#10;The Congress will be held in “het Pand” Congress Centre of Ghent University. ‘Het Pand’ is an old Dominican monastery located in the heart of the city on the banks of the river Leie, near the medieval port with the guildhalls as its remnants. It was recently acquired by Ghent University and converted to a congress center. The venue is located in the heart of the historical city center, within walking distance of all major hotels and touristic attractions. Ghent is a vibrant city, nested between Brussels and the coast, with a population of around 300,000 inhabitants.&#10;&#10;</field>

The European Society of Anaesthesiology, the new ESA as we know it today, was born in January 2005 and has developed into a strong, dynamic and extremely successful medical society. The ESA has a worldwide reputation of professionalism and excellence and formally became the European Regional Section of the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists (WFSA) in July 2014. We will be celebrating 10 years of our society’s achievements during our flagship event in Berlin.&#10;&#10;We have grown to expect a state-of-the art educational and scientific programme at the annual congress. Once again Euroanaesthesia 2015 will not disappoint us. Under the joint leadership of Prof Stefan De Hert and Prof Charles Marc Samama, the Scientific Committee has elaborated an outstanding programme full of cutting edge innovations in basic and clinical science, innovation in clinical application, in education and in quality and safety improvement. Research from investigators around the world will be presented in special lectures, interactive sessions, as well as the traditional abstract-based programme with presentations in front of electronic poster boards. Pre-congress courses and workshops are as always an integral part of the Euroanaesthesia programme.&#10;&#10;A significant new approach to the programme is the reorganisation of the congress into 17 Learning Tracks based on topics, no longer following the structure of the Scientific Committee and its Subcommittees. As of Stockholm, the Scientific Subcommittee Meetings are open to all ESA members. We encourage you to attend and to contribute to the discussions. The schedule will be published in the Final Programme.&#10;&#10;The Basic Sciences Anaesthetic Course organised in parallel with the congress is growing in popularity. Please make sure your young colleagues are aware of this course which is invaluable in the preparation of the EDAIC exam. A Part II EDAIC exam session in English and German will be organised pre-congress so that candidates can also attend Euroanaesthesia. Places are limited so please register well before the January deadline.&#10;&#10;The Plenary Session highlight, the Sir Robert Macintosh Lecture, is well known for attracting inspirational and motivating speakers. This year is no exception. Professor Isabelle Murat, eminent paediatric anaesthesiologist, will share the knowledge and experience gained through her dedicated and reputed career. She has long campaigned to improve safety in paediatric anaesthesia worldwide and in particular in Africa and Asia. Professor Murat, a crusader for better care of children, will address the topical but controversial subject of anaesthesia moving to subspecialities.&#10;&#10;We trust that the combination of education, science, research, networking and socialising will make Euroanaesthesia 2015 another unforgettable event. We look forward to welcoming you to Berlin!</field>

As you may or may not know, I will be your program chair for the 2015 ISMRM Annual Meeting in Toronto. Over the months that lead us to the annual meeting, you will receive several personal notes from me. These notes will be short!! – I know you are all super busy. In my tenure on the road to being program chair, I have tried to make my contributions to the annual meeting a representation of what the membership wants. You will see that the Toronto 2015 is YOUR meeting. The content reflects membership survey outcomes for plenary and educational content. And these personal notes will be no exception!!&#10;&#10;I will invite the membership to submit questions to be addressed or comments/ editorials to be featured that focus on the city of Toronto, or any part of the annual meeting. As special incentive to make this an interactive process, one featured membership question or comment/ editorial will be chosen by a panel (appointed by ME!!) to receive a complementary attraction passport AND one gift certificate from a local vendor. This was kindly provided by Tourism Toronto (Check them out HERE.)&#10;&#10;We are SO fortunate to have our annual meeting in Toronto. This is an AMAZING city that reflects the society in so many ways. It is considered a continental gateway and international crossroads, a city with diverse and colorful neighborhoods, with more than 100 cultures and lifestyles celebrated in Greater Toronto. As we correspond in the months to come, I will draw your attention to DIVERSITY and the sense of COMMUNITY in the city of Toronto, and in the ISMRM. We are visiting a city that we know as a society, a city that offers us familiarity, and welcomes us back with open arms. This offers us a unique opportunity to learn more about our destination, both physicially and as a society. I challenge you to focus on ways that our society can preserve its sense of community as we grow, stay connected with each other and nurture our diversity.</field>

While Nerve growth factor (NGF) was the first neurotrophic factor when it was identified more than 50 years ago, a large set of related and unrelated extracellular proteins are now known to exert neurotrophic effects in the developing and mature nervous system. The roles of neurotrophic factors include regulation of cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, migration, axon and dendrite growth, synaptic plasticity and the interactions of neuronal and glial cells. As a result, neurotrophic factors affect complex behaviors including feeding, anxiety, depression and learning, and aberrations in the activities of neurotrophic factors have been implicated in multiple neurologic and psychiatric disorders.&#10;&#10;The Neurotrophic Factors Gordon Conference provides a great opportunity to learn of recent advances in this broad field, and enhances collaborations among scientists and students. The meeting will feature work on diverse neurotrophic factors and their roles in neurogenesis, neuronal migration, survival, plasticity, behavior and diseases, including disorders of neural development such as autism and epilepsy and degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease and peripheral neuropathies. Emphasis will be placed on the most recent developments. </field>
